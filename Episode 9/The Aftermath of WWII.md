Music] see I think it's quite possible that the

1960s represented the last burst of the human being before he was extinguished

and that this is the beginning of the rest of the future now that from now on there'll simply be all these robots

walking around feeling nothing thinking nothing and there'll be nobody left

almost to remind them that there once was a species called a human being with

feelings and thoughts and that history and memory are right now being erased and soon nobody will really remember

that life existed on the

planet

for you know itch

foreign the combat

yeah wow

i grew up just as every other American looking back at World War II of which my father was a veteran in fact of the

Normandy invasion d-day plus two um I look back on with other Americans with great pride at what

Americans were able to do and and and to liberate uh Europe and and so on however

I don't feel the same way about that war anymore and I'm convinced that if my father was still living um that he would

also greatly question what he had actually participated in again the

Soviet Union was manipulating the American war effort and the British war effort as well in order to defeat Hitler

to supplant him with Stalin and this is exactly what happened the logic of the

map is what tells us that what I'm saying has credence because when you look at that post-war map what happened

there is a devastated Germany and in that vacuum there is a new thriving

powerful US supplied Soviet empire in its

[Music] place world War II was the crossroads of

human history it was a battle of two opposing ideologies philosophies and world views it was a battle between

nationalism and globalism it was a war between Germany and the Jewish powers who control the Allied governments and

their media adafler and his allies fought to preserve the concept of nationalism not just for Germans but for

all peoples the world over the world that we are living in today is the world of the victors of

that war this is the world of globalism capitalism and communism

[Music]

the outcome of World War II decided the fate of our civilization countries did not lose the Second World War but

humanity as a whole over 60 million people died in the most horrific war in

human history after Germany's defeat Europe was placed back again under the heel of the bankers where it remains to

this day the old debt payments originating from the post treaty of Versale was reinstituted in 1948 and was

not paid off until 2010 germany is now totally controlled

by the Rothschild Goldman Sachs and the Federal Reserve these same forces of

international yuri are the very same about which Adolf Hitler tried to forewarn the German people all of

Germany's gold reserves are now held in the US Federal Reserve Bank of New

York today the German people find themselves in the same state of economic servitude which Hitler tried to correct

germany is still paying off war operations for World War II

[Music] on the 23rd of May 1949 the western

allies ratified a new German constitution known as the basic law gungisets 2 days prior a secret state

treaty gaimer starts was also signed this granted complete allied control

over education and all licensed media press radio television and publishing houses until the year 2099

germany is still an occupied land with over 100,000 foreign troops stationed on

her soil and the Jews have never made peace with her no peace treaty has been concluded with any of the Allied powers

free speech and freedom of thought is gone not only in Germany but in most parts of Europe

the Jew Martin Schulz president of the European Parliament explained "The new Germany exists only in order to ensure

the existence of the state of Israel and the Jewish people." There you have World War II in one quote that was what the

war was all about breaking down Germany and making her a milking cow to the bankers again

[Music] the globalist United Nations began with

the London Declaration of 12th of June 1941 the name United Nations was coined

by Franklin Roosevelt and was used during the declaration by United Nations of January 1942 on June 26th 1945 the

founding charter for the United Nations was signed at the founding San Francisco conference that established the United

Nations the US official serving as secretary general was the communist agent Algar who was exposed as a Soviet

spy in 1948 the UN replaced the globalist league of nations as the

foundation of the globalist new world order the UN was put up based upon Karl

Marx's communist manifesto but this time the whole world would slowly be turned

into the new Soviet Union the new world government would now be headquartered in

New York on 18 acres of prime real estate donated by the Rockefeller family

this was the final nail in the coffin international communism had officially

won the war the globalist NATO and EU also came as a consequence from the war

as stepping stones to a future world government

the United Nations the Council of Foreign Relations the Trilitarial Commission the Bilderberg Group the

Gorbachev Foundation and the Club of Rome and many other shadowy fifth column

organizations now work together to destabilize the sovereign nations to create a communist world order communism

would spread from the Soviet Union with the help of communist Jews even in China

Soviet Jews were at work helping Maetung high up in the political department of the Red Army in China where WN Levitev

and JB Gamarik by progressive social movements in the name of helping people

communism killed over 60 million in the Soviet Union 70 million in the People's

Republic of China 3 million in Korea 2 million in

Cambodia 1.7 million in Africa 1.6 million in Vietnam 1.6 million in Poland

1.5 million in Afghanistan 1.2 2 million in Tito Yugoslavia 1 million elsewhere

in Eastern Europe 1 million in Ethiopia 400,000 in Romania 200,000 in

Bulgaria 150,000 in Latin America 100,000 in Mongolia 100,000 in Albania

73,000 in Cuba 70,000 in the German Democratic Republic 65,000 in

Czechoslovakia 27,000 in Hungary 10,000 by communist parties not

empowered and the international communist movement yet no movies no

Holocaust reparations no memorials for these victims the communist flag is not

banned and communist policies are still normalized and Marxism is even taught as

standard in our schools

western civilization that literally took thousands of years to develop with the help of the Romans laying the foundation

was destroyed in less than two centuries all healthy societal norms have been

broken down healthy nationalism has been replaced with a culture of guilt

ethnomasochism self-hatred apathy degeneracy and pathological altruism

traditionalism is labeled sick and outdated views on parenting have changed

significantly just 50 years ago a person in Europe was first considered to be a

grown-up after they had created a strong family thanks to the cultural Marxist brainwashing Europeans don't anymore

believe their position in society will be improved by having offspring consequently they instead focus on

materialist matters to fill up their void of unfulfillment as Europeans we

are no longer defined by our virtues or intellects we do not longer exist as

people with common history heritage or values we have been reduced into

rootless culturalists genderless alienated infertile overmedicated and

undereducated taxed and debt slaves we are no longer people defined by our

qualities or intellects we have become soulless machines taxpayers and human

resources we are defined solely by our net worth and our ability to consume

crap that we don't even need people no longer talk with each other on the streets we have forgotten everything

that meant something to our ancestors we have lost touch with both our past and our present and we live in some

imaginary fantasy world where happiness is just around the corner but never

really is found this is the world of blind equality where all sexes races

cultures ethnicities are the same in one homogeneous rootless gray goop each

individual is the same without roots identities or cultures we will be

exploited by the tyrannical global elite our identities are installed into us by

the state instead of our parents our people are stripped of a past to defend in our future the European spirit that

was rooted in vital institutions such as family farm folk and the community has

been totally wiped out we are no longer defined by common cultures traditions

bloodlines and set of everlasting values we are not united in our desire to

protect our culture and way of life this is our modern world this is

the world of consumerism nihilism haninism and empty materialism

[Music]

the world of uninspiring generic modern abstract art and architecture the destruction of Western

civilization is applauded as something progressive and tolerant we now live in

the world of sheep shine imports for the rich and eternal wage slavery for the

poor this is the world of globalism installed by the victors of the second

world war by the ideology of international communism this was exactly

what the national socialists during World War II tried to warn humanity

[Music] of

our governments are acting on behalf of influential lobbyists nos and globalist

organizations which in turn work for a global elite the essential driving force

and cohesive core of this global elite consists of Jews who see the ethnic

transformation of former white homogeneous western countries as beneficial for ethnically Jewish

minority interests because of historical religious and mere tactical reasons many

Jews view the white race as their greatest enemy and the fight for power and influence it is critical to realize

that these powers do not have our well-being in mind in their eyes we are

simply seen as their cattle in a multicultural society with other more

visible and on the surface more problematic minority groups Jews appear

as a seemingly invisible minority and not as an outside hostile social

category in this way the Jews can safely continue to exercise their power by

pushing their specific ethnic group interests at the expense of the indigenous populations all the Jewish

organizations got on board with the idea that we have to import other peoples we

have to change the uh demographic profile of these societies so that they

will not be homogeneous anymore that they will not be able to gang up against the Jews so I think I think those are

the two big reasons one is to push aside previous elites to make room for a Jewish elite but also to the the fear

and real hatred that that Jews have had historically towards white Christian

societies the most powerful globalist currently is the Hungarian Jew George

Soros he is known for his intense hatred for white people and having his long

tentacles in basically everything that weakens western civilization everything that divides and

inflames minorities with hatred for white Europeans soros's non-governmental

organizations have engineered the migrant crisis knowing full well that there will inevitably be a major culture

clash soros funds the divide and conquer terror organization black lives matter

that encourages violence against whites soros funds the radical feminist organization feminine who pits white

women against their own men teach them to hate their fathers and despise their brothers through relentless bashing of

the hetrohite male feminine and other feminist organizations while marching

around bare breasted advocate for radical Islam a religion that cuts up

the clitorises of little girls and requires the women to be covered up from head to toe

[Music]

[Applause]

not only Germany and Europe lost the Second World War but even the nations in the Middle East as the Zionists and

neocons invented the fictitious war on terror after the 9/11 attacks to

destabilize any nation that would try to emulate the economic success of national socialist Germany and go against the

globalists about 10 days after 911 I went through the Pentagon and I saw Secretary Rumsfeld and and Deputy

Secretary Wolfowitz i went downstairs just to say hello to some of the people on the joint staff who used to work for

me and one of the generals called me in he said "Sir you got to come in you got to come in and talk to me a second." I said "Well you're too busy." He said "No

no." He says "You we've made the decision we're going to war with Iraq."

This was on or about the 20th of September i said "We're going to war with Iraq why

he said "I don't know." He said "I guess they don't know what else to

do." So uh I said "Well did they find some information collect connecting Saddam to Al Qaeda?" He said "No no." He

says "There's nothing new that way they've just made the decision to go to war with Iraq." He said "I guess it's

like we don't know what to do about terrorists but we've got a good military and we can take down governments." And

um he said "I guess if if the only tool you have is a hammer every problem has to look like a

nail." So I came back to see him a few weeks later and by that time we were

bombing in Afghanistan i said "Are we still going to war with Iraq?" And he said "Oh it's worse than that." He said

he reached over on his desk he picked up a piece of paper he said "I just" He said "I just got this down from upstairs," meaning the Secretary of

Defense's office today and he said "This is a memo that describes how we're going to take out seven countries in 5 years

starting with Iraq and then Syria Lebanon Libya Somalia Sudan and finishing off Iran

what is Israel's role in this?" Ken O'Keefe well the Greater Israel Project is all

about uh destabilizing uh surrounding nations ultimately in pursuit of this

dream of greater Israel from the Euphrates down to the Nile all the way over to the Eastern Mediterranean this

is the dream of these psychopaths and so destabilizing governments creating sectarian strife is all part of that

menu and all part of the design to create greater Israel so that that that goes uh that's self-evident but I have

to go back to what this gentleman is saying in Washington DC about America not wanting to get involved or Obama not

getting involved what are you talking about we have been arming people directly who are al-Qaeda al-nusra Front

is al-Qaeda these people are psychopaths to the worst order they're conducting

suicide attacks they're gassing people we know Carla Delp Ponte said in May

that it was the so-called rebels in Syria that were using sarin gas not the the Bashar al-Assad regime no it was not

we know that the United States president is arming people who are on the US terrorist list he should be convicted of

aiding and abetting giving material support to a terrorist organization but then again you know what we are we the

West the United States in particular Israel and Britain are the biggest terrorists on the planet so our little

junior partners in al-Qaeda which is nothing more than a CIA database thus the name al-Qaeda this is nothing more

than a group of terrorists working together each playing one different role but all of them working together for the

same goal which is to maintain this hideous and sick and twisted injust world that we have which is a perpetual

state of war always one illusion one boogeyman after another but the fact is Obama is nothing more than a puppet war

criminal just like his predecessor and every other US president before him so please don't tell people out there that

the US is not involved it's directly involved and it is arming people who are absolute psychopaths that is what we

discussed earlier the Greater Israel project to destabilize any Arab regime which might have any kind of autonomy

and self-determination any regime in the Arab world that is not an absolute puppet cannot be tolerated and who are

the nations that we target those that are not puppets we don't target those like the Saudi regime which is the

biggest human rights violator in that region it's cutting off people's heads in public cutting off hands it is the

most grotesque regime on the planet and yet we give that regime weapons and it's no problem whatsoever the duplicity and

hypocrisy of the United States and the West can't even be measured it is so enormous and these mouthpieces such as

this gentleman in Washington is only doing a disservice to himself and his country and the fact is that American

sons and daughters will get involved in this yet again and these chicken hawks who are pretending to care about the

Syrian people are going to be sacrificing not their own sons and daughters i would like this man to send

his sons and daughters and his grandchildren off to Syria when this turns into a greater conflict because

this is what we're flirting with is a world war a third world war this is not a joke we are flirting with a third

world war on the basis that apparently we care so much about the Syrian people just like we care so much about the

Iraqi people and the Afghani people the only people that buy this sort of stuff are either bought off prostitutes or the

dumbest of the dumb and we're also led to believe that Assad is the dumbest

idiot dictator on the planet now isn't he because he invited UN inspectors to come in and he brought them in on the

very day that they come in he decides to attack his own people 10 miles away from where the inspectors arrive this is

beyond ridiculous and the only people that buy this again are bought off prostitutes or the dumbest of the dumb

the greater Israel plan was actually pre-planned by Theodore Herzel long before when he said the area of the

Jewish state stretches from the brook of Egypt to the Euphrates

but they did not learn what went on in World War II the perpetrators the victorious allies and their Jewish

handlers they hit the crimes from the world with a blitz of books TV programs documentaries and movies as you point

out and to this day look around you look around ourselves we have wars in the Middle East non-stop for the sake of

Israel and Israel alone now Israel has a proxy called the United States let's just call him Uncle Stupid or Uncle

Sucker every time Israel wants an enemy taken out whether it's Afghanistan whether it's Iraq or hopefully I mean

hopefully not Iran they want us to attack Iran well they just point their pitbull Uncle Stupid in that direction

and Uncle Stupid dutifully goes to war with that nation and destroys it that has got to stop we didn't learn from

World War II and we're still committing the same mistakes

being a a dreadful awful ghastly racist such as myself does tend to give me an

advantage because it means I can actually talk about race and we do need

to talk about race because the 21st century unless things change we'll see

the virtual extinction of my white European

race back in Europe and by extension America Canada and Australia the

indigenous people cultures and nations have now lost their right to exist in their own homelands and are now facing

extinction in fact today it is basically a crime

for an area to be too white no school no town no nation is allowed to be white

anymore yet there are no one pushing for Israel the Middle East Africa or Asia to

become multicultural right the indigenous people of Europe are treated like secondclass citizens in their own

countries the governments are actively working to lift up so-called minorities

and push whites down as an example of the utter hypocrisy Israel Saudi Arabia

United Arab Emirates Qatar Kuwait and Bahrain have refused to take in refugees

so have you seen any media footage about this have you seen anyone calling them

racist while white European women of childbearing age today are a small

minority of 2% of the entire world's population they are encouraged to breed

outside of their own race to throw away thousands of years of ethnic heritage

and culture the result will be that those pure genetics that have been refined in Europe for thousands of years

will be gone forever so what is diversity is it

this or is it this according to the establishment this is not diverse but

this very diverse not diverse very diverse no diversity here so diverse we

get it the meaning of diversity as used by the establishment is everyone but

white people well unless there are sexual deviants so it's everyone but straight white people diversity is being

rewritten to mean the inclusion of individuals representing more than one

national origin color religion socioeconomic group sexual orientation

did you get that this definition says it's non-whites Muslims Jews and anyone

not Christian poor people meaning the third world and sexual deviants according to them if you don't include

these groups you will never qualify as diverse so if you're a straight white

person living in a homogeneous nationalist Christian white country you won't ever get a gold star for

diversity this new definition of diversity was inspired by Marxist critical theory which arose from the

Frankfurt School in the 30s they were hostile communists who fled to America

and pushed words like racism xenophobia anti-semite to seow division they

pointed their fingers at others while they agreed with violent communist revolutions that killed more than any

other ideology on the planet you know what diversity doesn't include for a Marxist diversity of political opinions

diversity can only mean thinking like a leftist they're not welcoming a wide range of political viewpoints they're

not saying it doesn't matter if you're a rightist because we accept you no they shout Nazi racist and demand censorship

they want to ruin your life and destroy you because of your deferring political views they don't want diversity of

thought they want leftist rule where dissenting opinions are shut down by force diversity is used as a weapon

against nationalists and leftists use minority groups to further their agenda to be the wedge that breaks apart the

cohesion of the majority we were told we must overcome our racist nature and

embrace open borders for a more utopian world where we accept everyone holding

hands as one we're told it's our duty as white people that we alone hold the key

to usher in world peace it's up to us to make our countries a home for everyone

where all races religions and ideologies live together in our country because only white people are racist well if you

want to talk about peace the most peaceful countries in the world happen to be white when someone says "You white

people aren't diverse and can only become diverse by importing the third world into your countries." This is

psychological warfare an action intended to undermine our morale and unity as a people an enemy can use pretty words

while having dirty motives remember communists talked about the greater good

while they mass murdered millions of Russians who disagreed and stood in the way of their utopia migrant invaders in

Europe learn very fast to shout racism and diversity because it gets them stuff

they don't care about sharing inequality they want to be the king on the top

money money money the Europeans are the most compassionate and giving of any

people third world nations receive billions in aid from us and when they need medicine or education who do they

call us but our goodwill is also easy to take advantage of we get hustled it's

sad but a white man can go to the moon but just don't call him racist or he'll have a breakdown that's how deep

anti-white propaganda and lies has rotted our morale and confidence as a people we don't even take our own side

because it's practically the Holocaust if we do in the beginning leftists who pushed the dream of diversity were naive

idealists but not anymore despite terrorist attacks increasing violence

rape and constant conflict in our multicultural societies we continue to be propagandized at every level that

diversity is our strength we're expected to deny reality the truth is in our face

and the whites who live in diverse areas have to take the brunt of it rich white liberals who are activists

for diversity live in their ivory towers surrounded by other rich white people

chauffeurred from white place to white place untouched by all diversity harvard

political scientist and leftist Robert Putnham sent out to do a study on how awesome diversity is what did he really

learn when you shove a bunch of different people together diversity it creates less social cohesion distrust

conflict and it hurts overall civic life people stop trusting each other and they

stop being nice and happy daily life becomes a battle when you mix thousands

of people together from different cultures and languages religions social

classes and political views they won't get along what a shocking revelation

diversity isn't like the TV shows where one of each race and creed goes shopping and launches together talking about how

awesome liberalism is before the word diversity white Americans were once whole as a united group in a country

that was nearly entirely white even blacks did better during segregation versus today it is diversity that has

divided white people we are now divergent if there's a white neighborhood company government or movie

we hear how it needs diversity in other words it needs non-whites it is all

about race all about replacing white people wherever they are we can't have

anything that is all our own without hearing non-whites complain about it

they want us to facilitate them in everything we create and they shout slavery colonialism Jim Crow white

supremacy to get a leg up because they couldn't do it on their own people give

your [ __ ] money your [ __ ] house your [ __ ] property we need it [ __ ]

all you need a reparate it's a strategy to win and they didn't even come up with

it on their own non-white minority groups have learned they can get ahead

simply by crying diversity even when they're not qualified for the position it's a shakeddown out groups have

learned they can align together cry minority and chisel their way into our spaces weakening our cohesion as a group

it's a power grab all the while they pretend to care about the goodwill of all mankind through pretty words like

equality and tolerance diversity but their actions say the opposite they want

their group to hold power and influence they also want revenge and think white people owe them but we don't they don't

care about the truth they want to get ahead and they want to win as a group it's not white people going to black or

Asian areas demanding they include white people in every facet of their existence

they have things that are exclusively theirs and they also have countries where they are the majority they have no

obligation to include anyone else and neither do we we whites should be a

majority in our country we made every aspect of it there's nothing wrong with us being dominant in our own country but

even though we are still a majority we're told it's supremacy when we occupy the majority of society as white

societies become increasingly diverse there's no end in sight and in cities where non-whites are the majority

they're calling for an end to white privilege even though the job market openly discriminates against whites and

we hear how campuses must end racism even when they are fully dictated by diversity politics when will diversity

finally be achieved at what point will commies and non-whites be satisfied i'll

tell you when Europeans no longer have an identity culture or country all their

own when white people no longer exist

it's a kind of utopia just the fact that the whole world will mix up with each other that in I don't know 70 80 years

there will be no white people anymore and only capuccino colored people look that's the only way this is the solution

is my way of mixed up it's our only hope is our way out of this it's going to take some time but it's really the only

way this the sort of Singaporean model where everybody's so mixed up that you really don't know who to hate because

everybody's so hopelessly intertwined but we're a long way from that they're advocating the biggest genocide in all

of history i mean once white is gone it's gone you ain't going to get it back right it's just interesting because it's

this is only targeting whites they're not talking about no more brown people or no no more black people just no more

white people cuz then that will solve the problem if we're all just darker skinned then we won't hate each other

this is the solution to the problem cappuccino colored you know that's right they started talking about cologne and

all the rapes and then it goes into the the final solution the only solution is

for those women to have brown babies are you [ __ ] kidding me i think that we should go down there and tell them that

Jews and Palestinians should blend for peace right yeah of course you You need to just end this by mixing yourself out

and have mixed babies and then maybe the conflict will end exactly well there's another coincidence though and you

brought this out the changing face of America do you remember that pushing all this oh yeah yeah of course lisa

Thunderberg who turns out is Jewish you know remember these pictures of these

very unrealistic babies oh yeah yeah the dream of the mocha colored uh future of

of all of us israel has a huge wall around its country there will be no white people anymore

let's take a look at Israel in the meantime right okay fine i get that it's not a problem you don't want these people in your countries i get that but

then don't come and judge us for not wanting it and push it into our countries that's the problem I have with

here israel recognizes less than 1% of asylum seekers i mean talk about the

utter hypocrisy they even have DNA um you know issues in terms of immigration

right that you have to have for you to get in uh to Israel you have to be Jewish by by DNA that is correct and and

and it's actually worse it's worse than that because what they're doing now is that they're actually shipping people

out of Israel to send them to places like Sweden right so they actually pay

specifically African migrants because Jews many Jews in Israel they actually

hate blacks they have a huge problem with racism in Israel but they're going to the the shores of Europe to welcome

Syrian migrants African migrants uh Afghani migrants Iraqi migrants pointing

the way standing out and like waving you know here here it is coming this way right y literally literally doing that

again you have Jewish women showing up in Europe in a country that is not theirs that are welcoming invaders let's

go to Israel i said this on Twitter let's get a good group together go to Israel start up some aid you know and

then welcome just welcome all the non-Jews the Arabs the Africans why

can't we do that what what would happen then how about we go there and set up aid for the Palestinians and why aren't these women doing that if they claimed

that oh we're in such a good relationship with Muslims if we would have gone to Israel and done something

like this there would be military descending on us in in 10 minutes we probably wouldn't even make it there to

be honest of of invading their space right again without people realizing it's actually a huge strategy behind

this to bring in more migrants into into Europe to destroy them ethnically right they're against everything white and

pro- minority up and down they're they're pro gun control always pro gun control they're always pro minority

they're always pro- illegal immigration uh they're always pro- middle eastern war in American body bags they're always

anti-white jews are always foremost in promoting race mixing among whites and

browns and blacks uh you can see it in American TV as far back as 20 and 30 uh

40 years even and on on top of this actual phenomenon that we can all witness we have the propaganda every ad

I see now has some kind of mixed couple of sort i see this being pushed everywhere white men are made to look

nerdy and stupid they can't dance and they're so boring but the non-white men

are made to look strong masculine and heroic it is no longer a good thing to

have white children they are considered boring and undiverse

not only do you have propaganda which is massively anti-white we have weaponized

words anyone that talks about any of these topics is always called one particular word and can you guess what

that word is the rword racist anytime you have propaganda and weaponized words

especially words that are supposed to set off triggers to shut you down to keep you shut up and we have phenomenon

we're no longer in the realm of propaganda if you have propaganda backed up by phenomenon we're now into warfare

psychological warfare and psychological warfare is always reduced down to you know you're either with us or against us

you have to have something to say when people are calling you a name especially in a mean malicious way and the word

racist is used as a weapon all over Western civilization it's used to stigmatize it's used basically to

silence any opposition and what you want to do is not be silent so when someone calls you a racist you just say "You're

just saying it cuz I'm white." Anti-racism is a code word for anti-white racism only applies to white

people's homes white people's churches white countries it doesn't apply to anyone else they're not trying to yell

racism anywhere else racism is an anti-white hate slur is where really what it is and the phenomenon in Western

civilization is massive amounts of immigration you can't debate it you can't you can't even talk about it or

you're a Nazi you've all we've all heard the words before so we have forced immigration forced integration forced

assimilation and then they tell us though about our inevitable brown future they're doing this in white countries

and only white countries you know China is still going to be Chinese 50 years from now africa is still going to be Africa uh Saudi Arabia is still going to

be full of Arabs but we're all supposed to be blended

united Nations data show that the African population is rising from 200 million in 1950 to a projected

4.2 billion in 2000 this is an increase of

2,000% these projections foresee 40% of the world's population and about half of

its children being African by the end of this century the world has right now more than 60 million people that would

want to get to the west relocating these people geographically to every white country will not help anybody in our

nation's people and cultures will never survive it some people say that mass

immigration into the United States can help reduce world poverty is that true

well no it's not and let me show you why this gumball represents the 1 million

legal immigrants that the United States has taken every year on average since 1990 now who in the world deserves our

humanitarian compassion the World Bank has one measure of the desperately poor of the world they make less than $2 a

day and how many people make less than $2 a day in the world let's start with Africa in Africa alone there are 650

million people who make less than $2 a day 650 million

and in India another 890 million people

desperately poor china adds another 480 million people making less than $2 a day and

unfortunately the rest of Asia has a heartbreaking 810 million people who the

World Bank says make less than $2 a day and finally there's 105 million of Latin

America's population that are desperately poor all told the World Bank says there are three

billion people in the world three billion people who are desperately poor

making less than $2 a day that's 3,000 gumballs and every year we take a million and suggest that

we have somehow made a humanitarian difference of course we don't pull our

immigrants from these desperately poor populations do we these people are too poor too sick too disconnected to make

it here as immigrants we tend to pull our immigrants out of the better off poor of the world how many people in the

world live in countries that have average incomes lower than that of Mexico and the World Bank tells us that

that number is these three billion plus another 2.6 billion

people 5.6 six billion people in the [Music]

world who live in countries with average incomes below that of

Mexico that's 5,600 gumballs and so what is it that the elites are telling us

they're telling us that when we take this 1 million immigrants that we somehow another are

tackling world poverty and we have to do it regardless of the effect on our unemployed the working poor the most

vulnerable members of our society regardless of the effect on our natural resources even if we went by the most

radical proposals in Washington which are to actually

double our immigration to 2 million a

year which would totally overwhelm our physical natural and social infrastructures we couldn't make a

noticeable difference and we may be really hurting the impoverished people of the world because the million that we

do take are among the most energetic often the better educated certainly the most

dissatisfied people that if they did not immigrate would be the agents for change

to improve the lot of all the people in these countries the true heroes in the

global humanitarian field are the people in these countries who have the wherewithal to immigrate to another

country but instead stay in their countries to apply their skills to help their fellow countrymen

unfortunately our immigration system tends to entice these very type of people to abandon their countrymen the

impossibility of making even a dent is actually worse than it looks

here because last year when we took 1 million

immigrants these countries added birth over deaths 80 million more people into

the impoverished population and this year Congress is

bringing in a million legal immigrants and this year according to the United

Nations these countries are expected to add another 80 million people and next

year you can be quite sure that Congress unless stopped by the American voters

will bring in another million immigrants and these countries unfortunately will be

adding another 80 million people into these impoverished nations we could take

5 million a year but we'd never get ahead of what's happening in these

countries not in this century don't you see immigration can never be an

effective or significant way to deal with the suffering people of the world they have to be helped where they

live 99.9% of them will never be able to

immigrate to rich country there's no hope for that they have to bloom where they're planted the only place that

99.9% of these people can be helped is where they

live let's help them there what is happening today is the replacement of the white race which the

UN even admits to and calls replacement migration this is in fact according to

the UN's definition a genocide white genocide massive non-white immigration

to all European white countries is textbook genocide

genocide is simply the intentional attempt to get rid of an ethnic group or

destroy its foundations of life which is exactly what is happening to white Europeans in the world as millions of

hostile third world migrants are flooding their countries changing their demographics rapidly at the very same

time our establishment is promoting abortion divorce feminism hookup culture

misogynation and homosexuality to lower the birth rates of the white Europeans

[Music] after the fall of the Third Reich

Jenocidal Kaufman Kudenhov Kaleri and the Hutam plans for Germany became the

reality for all of Western Europe through the creation of the European Union and the UN not only Germany but

the entire white western world has since then undergone attacks of unprecedented

scales demographically that will lead to the indigenous European populations very

soon becoming minorities in the homelands of their own ancestors figures compiled for the program suggest that in

the next 20 years the ethnic diversity of this city will change dramatically for the first time ever the number of

people who class themselves as white British is now a minority in London people who identify as white British

citizens are now a minority in their capital city white folks are on track to

becoming and I hate to say this the minority in America

a new report out by the government shows that by the year 2042 white Americans will no longer represent the majority of

the population that prediction is 8 years sooner than previously expected that the native French population would

be finding itself in a rapidly decreasing minority

children from white families in Birmingham are set to become a minority group for the first time when this

year's census is collected in March the latest census suggests white British

born are now in a minority census Bureau says white will be a minority californians know a thing or two about

demographic change 70% of all state school pupils in Los Angeles are

Hispanic for the first time in American history non-whites will make up half or more of

the next generation according to a new study by the Pew Research Center the latest census suggests that white Brits

are now in a minority in London and the fact that we are going to become a minority in our own country before 2050

well before 2050 for for the younger people when the the parent culture kind

of dissipates um you you're left thinking well what what's going Come on

[Music]

it's the end of days you're going to need the iron of his which represents Edom

which is the west Europe and the Americas to get intermixed with ishal

which is basically Arabs and and Muslims how in the world was this ever going to happen if not for this refugee crisis at

the end of days you're going to have this intermixing between isav which is the west and the east

which is the Muslims and the um and and the Arabs making this through this

influx into the world and they're going to have children you know I don't want to say by the dozens but they're going

to have a far larger birth rate than the indigenous people there and they're

going to sort of conquer by number and there are many different sources for this um one of them

in chapter 14 and many other sources as far as this is concerned where it's mentioned very very um vividly what will

happen to the Jews and what will happen to Jerusalem and what will happen to the world at that time where there will be

many many people killed and so on and so forth so the idea of having these refugees come into Europe it's no longer

a matter of whether it's right or wrong it's just simply a fulfillment of what it was meant to be all along this is the

fulfillment of you know the and the prophecies this has to happen and this

is just another sign that we are nearing you know the completion of the statement of the entire world

i think there's a resurgence of anti-semitism because at this point in time Europe has not yet learned how to

be multicultural and I think we're going to be part of the throws of that of that transformation which must take place

europe is not going to be the monolithic uh um societies that they once were in

the last century jews are going to be at the center of that it's a huge transformation for Europe to make they

are now going into a multicultural mode and Jews will be resented because of our leading role but without that leading

role and without that transformation Europe will not survive there are two issues at the top of our agenda at the

very moment uh one is the unbelievably important immigration debate in this

country to make sure that immigrants from around the world particularly those from south of our border have a chance

here the 12 million that 13 million that just live here and do work and aren't really going home that they have a

chance to to stay here justly and with as as legal immigrants now coming back

to your uh question of the clash between the secular post-Christian Europe and

the new uh immigration wave which is essentially religious yes this is what exactly what is happening there is a

clash of civilizations and uh we the Jews we are in the middle of this clash

of civilizations um I've always believed that Britain is a country of migrants

i'm Jewish the Jews want us dead because we have been their greatest challenge

ever since they started their program of basically dividing and conquering

for AJC has always worked on the premise that as a minority

um our security our strength our well-being in America is interdependent

with those of other minorities this is a Jewish issue

the thing that makes Judaism dangerous to everybody to every race to every

nation to every idea is that we smash things that aren't true we don't believe in the boundaries of nation state we

don't believe in the ideas of these individual gods that that you know that protect individual groups of people

these are all artificial constructions and Judaism really teaches us how to see that in a sense our detractors have us

right in that we are a corrosive force we're breaking down the false gods of

all nations and all people because they're not real immigration is the future you cannot work and um live in a

globalized world in in the middle of the world in Europe without immigration and

uh moving populations so you have to really make a good policy of immigration

all over Europe and we see this that the history of Europe with this long history

of nationalism and small countries is now um is now getting into a crisis so

um this will be um um this will be need will need a long time to uh to make it

better but you have to in front this you have to really uh change the policy of

uh of immigration inside Europe this is very important you have to make adapt

the educational system and adapt all the um uh all the self understanding of the

states uh they are not anymore only white or only Swedish or only Portuguese

or only German they are multicultural um places in the world

[Music] the Liberal Democrats will always stand

up for a Britain that is open tolerant and diverse and in that spirit I very

much welcome the Jewish European election manifesto calling for a strengthening of EU hate crime

legislation as a party we wholeheartedly value the relationship we have with the Jewish community both in Britain and

internationally we see ourselves together fighting together with our

Muslim brothers and they are our natural allies

so how many people in Europe would be eligible under the law of return to move here 3 million 4 million maybe

altogether it could change the geopolitics what do you mean that it could change the geopolitics

you know it's the demography is the key of everything as you know between the Jordan and the Mediterranean this is the

borders 10 million people about half million Jews and half million Arabs and

if we want to remain a democratic state we have to have a majority of Jews

in this place europe is not always going to be there i'm afraid 2025 in Europe will be very

different to 2015 and 2035 will be different to 2025 add

infinitum and this is purely down to demographics you know the uh the English

have uh have have taken on board the preaching of the feminist groups and we no longer have enough children and we're

now down to 1.5 child per couple which means tomorrow's generation is 25%

smaller uh than today's generation but the Islamic immigrants

coming in are averaging four children per couple and that's not just per

couple because they also have four wives not all of them but but some of them so

some of them are having 16 children per one man and

furthermore when the average English woman if she can be bothered to have a child at all is in her mid30s or early

40s these Muslim women are having children aged 16 to 21 we are really

going to start to notice the the rise not just in demographics but as they

grow they they start demanding more and they start pushing more and because they back this up with with terrorism and

with jihad the government listens to them you know they push we submit and

that's what's happening in Britain and of course with laws in uh in in Denmark and all across Europe Sweden is

literally a lost country you know we in Britain have maybe two decades before

everything really hits the wall in Sweden we're looking at 5 years to 10

years and Sweden has terrible enormous problems malma is now the rape capital

of the European continent aside from South Africa I

think it's the rape capital of the world it is that bad by the time the politicians have finally got the balls

to stand up and tell the truth it may be too late at that time from demographic

reasons to actually do anything about it i came here really today to to make the

point that do not let what has happened in Europe and in Britain happened to

America you all need to look at what's happening in Britain and Sweden and Europe and you

all need to make sure that you've retained your First Amendment rights because unless we can talk about this

unless we can bring it out in the open you in America will go the same way you need to stand up and look at what we're

doing and say this is never going to happen here thank you

[Applause] a lot of the Jews that I've talked to seem to be very pro- immigration but not

to Israel like do you think that Israel should be taking a lot of Syrian

refugees in um it's probably not in their self-interest um it's not what I

asked uh um man that's hard um really probably i

mean yes or no uh probably not why uh well uh cuz they they sort of

want to kill the people uh that they're that they're that they would immigrate to

my concern is uh is doing away with whiteness whiteness is a form of racial oppression sure the suggestion is that

is somehow possible to separate whiteness from oppression and it is not

there can be no white race without the phenomenon of white supremacy if you abolish slavery you abolish slaveholders

in the same way if you abolish racial oppression you do away with whiteness treason to whiteness is loyalty to

humanity your views are are fairly wellreceived in academia legit yes they're legitimate not to say that

everyone agrees but sure i could not point to any examples where

it has provoked political censorship to me whiteness is an identity that arises entirely out of oppression whiteness is

not a culture it's not a religion it's not a language it's simply an oppressive social category black blackness is an

identity that can be plausibly argued to arise out of a resistance to oppression

black studies is a study of a people that has formed itself in resistance to

its oppression and the task is to bring this minority together in such a way

that it makes it impossible for the legacy of whiteness to continue to reproduce itself

[Music] europe must be

[Music] multicultural jews are going to be at the center of

[Music]

that heat heat

germany is facing a drastic number of refugees by the end of 2015 believed to be in the region of 1.5 million it is

not quite on a biblical scale but an exodus it certainly is migrants who've been trapped at the railway station in

Budapest now deciding to walk the hundreds of miles to Germany and what

they see as the promised land the other side of this tragedy is how it will change Europe non-western migrants had

already been flooding into Europe for decades leaders refuse to stop it we are afraid we are in danger every day every

minute they coming inside to the police they want to kill each other we have to you have to do

something someone has to protect us they are in our house we are the victims we

are not them we have to live like before we have to live our life they took it

for us we're not in war they are we have to take them from here it's a city no

place for people like them

godfather of the European Union Richard Guden of Keri published the plan for a

united Europe and of the ethnicide of the peoples of Europe the encouragement of non mass non-white immigration was

central to the plot since then an unholy alliance of leftists capitalists and

Zionist supremacists has schemed to promote immigration and misogynation with the deliberate aim of breeding us

out of existence in our own homelands as indigenous resistance to this human

genetic modification industry grows the criminal elite seeks new ways to camouflage their project first their

immigrant pawns were temporary guest workers then it was a multi-racial experiment then they were refugees then

the answer to a shrinking population different excuses different lies and

asylum is just another one but the real aim stays the same the biggest genocide

in human history the final solution of the Christian European problem this

crime demands a new set of Neuremberg trials and you people will be in the

dock mr president I'm really ashamed of the racist and xenophobic

uh terms that were used by Mr griffin and my only question to him is if he

dare to make any concrete suggestions and amendments to those legislation is your policy serious or you are you just

shouting and I hope you will not be reelected if you seek re-election because it's a shame for this parliament

the kind of statements you have just made it's you that shouting because obviously the truth hurts yes I will be

seeking re-election yes I hope to return here to speak up for the indigenous Europeans which the founder of this

place has deliberately set out to wipe out because that is a crime i'm telling the truth i have a constructive

suggestion to help those poor asylum seekers from Africa yes make it clear they can't come here so they don't try

to cross the sea and drown in huge numbers the best way for them is to get the banks off the backs of their

countries so they can live in peace in their countries and we Europeans can live in peace in

ours

there are increasing groups of people who are essentially asking the question if the political establishment continues

to get its way in five in 10 in 20 years time how many Germans are going to be

left in Germany how many French people are going to be left in France how many English people are going to be left in

England french writer Renard Kimu calls the influx the great replacement and says it's the biggest thing to happen to

France since the 15th century

[Music]

hardly anyone imagined just 20 years ago that the native French population would be finding itself in a rapidly

decreasing minority here london has got so ethnically diverse that white Britons

are now a minority here white families in Birmingham are set to become a minority group for the first time the

country's most rapidly growing demographic is Muslim with Muhammad now the most popular name for baby boys in

London the high Muslim birth rate is changing the political landscape imran is looking forward to replacing Belgian

law with Sharia law including amputation for theft stoning for adultery and death

to homosexuals if they want to push us back or something like that I don't know

maybe they can start to marry four wives and have a lot of children start with that maybe they will have a chance but I

don't think so something else that Muslim immigration appears to have brought to Norway is what some here call a rape epidemic recent police statistics

showed that in the capital of Oslo 100% of assault rapes between strangers were

committed by immigrant non-western males and nine out of 10 of their victims were native Norwegian women

they're taking this gay pride march through a predominantly Muslim neighborhood here in Stockholm and there

are fears that it could stoke tensions between some of the local residents and the people demonstrating here what's the

progation it's a progation against the Muslim man population

basically the US is providing these flows for us you make war and we get the refugees so um the United Nations report

says Sweden will be a third world nation in about 15 years below Libya and

Bulgaria [Music]

but there is no other path to victory except through sacrifice and jihad for

the sake of Allah swedes who disagree with that plan risk being labeled racist fascist even Nazi

this footage of the Revolutionary Front smashing the home of a suspected fascist is one of the many attacks

we're not even talking France we're not even talking Germany we're not even talking Belgium but any of the other countries in the EU in the UK alone we

have 23,000 known Giadis

23,000 that is larger than some portions of our

military we basically have a foreign military in our lands as a consequence

of this immigration policy and our politicians continue to

welcome tens of millions of Muslims into our country

our politicians are directly endangering the citizens of our

[Music] countries at the very least this is

extreme negligence at worst this is pure treason we cannot stand for this we

cannot let this [Music] happen we need to close our borders we

need to have the military on our borders guarding our borders now

yes but you also have a declining birth rate and you need uh for a flourishing

economy you need some growth and uh it has to be replaced by uh migrants from

from outside i believe in breaking down borders i believe in European

integration i was part of the 1992 process that removed borders

[Music]

that's

good [Music]

[Applause] heat heat

asim are mentally inferior to Jews and can't run their nations properly for

their sake and ours we need to abolish their governments and replace them with a single government this will take a

long time and involve much bloodshed but it's for a good cause here's what we'll

need to do place our agents and helpers everywhere take control of the media and

use it in propaganda for our plans start fights between different

races classes and religions use bribery threats and blackmail to get

our way use free Masonic lodges to attract potential public

officials appeal to successful people's egos appoint puppet leaders who can be

controlled by blackmail replace royal rule with

socialist rule then communism then despatism abolish all rights and

freedoms except the right by force by us sacrifice people including Jews

sometimes when necessary eliminate religion replace it with science and

materialism control the education system to spread deception and destroy

intellect rewrite history to our benefit create entertaining

distractions corrupt minds with filth and perversion encourage people to spy on

one another keep the masses in poverty and perpetual labor take possession of

all true wealth property and especially gold use gold to manipulate the markets

causing depressions etc introduce a progressive tax on wealth replace sound investment with

speculation make long-term interestbearing loans to

governments give bad advice to governments and everyone else eventually

the go will be so angry with their governments because we'll blame them for the resulting mess that they'll gladly

have us take over we will then appoint a descendant of David to be the king of the world and the remaining go will bow

down and sing his praises everyone will live in peace and obedient order under

his glorious rule [Music]

[Music]

[Music] um often when there is dissent expressed

in the United States against policies of the Israeli government um uh people here

are called anti-semitic what is your response to that as an Israeli Jew well it's a trick we always use it when from

Europe somebody is criticizing Israel then we bring up the Holocaust when in

this country people are criticizing Israel then there are anti-semitic and the organization is strong and has a lot

of money and the the ties between Israel

and the American estab Jewish establishment are very strong and they

are strong in this country as you know they have power which it's okay they are

talented people and they have power money and media and other things and

their attitude is Israel my country right or wrong the identification and they are not ready to

hear criticism and it's very easy to blame people who criticize certain acts

of the Israeli government as anti-semitics and to bring up the

Holocaust and the suffering of the Jewish people and that's that justify

everything we do to the Palestinian

Through the implementation of the Federal Reserve system the government has become uh vest in these bankers and

they get their money from the bankers and so then they impose a tax on us which

makes us more slaves makes it more difficult for us to survive right giving them more profits and now what's

happened is that uh through the the the federal system the bankers have pretty

much taken control of our government it doesn't matter Republican and Democrat anymore cuz they're both the same

neither one of them are talking about shutting down the federal system or stopping the payment of taxes you know

uh or any of the big issues that face Americans right and so uh I had a friend

Nick Rockefeller okay who was one of the Rockefeller family and he

uh uh when I was running for governor in Nevada he came to me introduced himself to me through an attorney and uh we

became friends we started talking about things and um I learned an awful lot from Mr

rockefeller and one of the things that we used to talk about was the ultimate

plan of the banking industry what they wanted to accomplish and the goals of

the uh banking industry not not just the Federal Reserve system but the private

banks in Germany in England all over Italy all over the world they all work together they're all central banks and

there and they're all part of the communist manifesto you know central banking is one of the major planks of

the communist manifesto we talk about America being a capitalistic country but yet at the same time we have a central

bank that plans everything for us right and the graduated income tax is another plank of the Communist Manifesto right

so right there you have two major planks of the Communist Manifesto they've been brought in because of the Federal Reserve system okay so uh the ultimate

goal that these people have in mind is the goal to um create a one world

government run by the banking industry run by the bankers where and and they're

doing it in sections the the European currency the euro and and the European constitution is one part of it now

they're trying to do it in America with the North American Union right and they want to create a new currency called the

Aomero right and uh the whole the whole agenda is to create a one world

government where everybody has an an RFID chip implanted in them all money is

to be um in those chips right there'll be no more cash and

this is given me straight from Rockefeller himself this is what they want to accomplish and all money will be in your chips and so any so instead of

having cash anytime you have money in your in your in your chip they can take

out whatever they want to take out whenever they want to if they say you owe us this much money in taxes they just deduct it out of your chip

digitally total control total control and if you're like me or you and you're

protesting what they're doing they can just turn off your chip and you have nothing you can't buy food you can't do

anything it's total control of the people and that chip's connected to a database that has your purchasing records what you do everything

everything is in there you know and so they want a one world government

controlled by them everybody being chipped all your money in those chips

and they control the chips and they control people and you become a slave you become a servant for these people

that's their goal that's their intentions all of what we can see happening in the world is part of

greater plans called the agenda 21 agenda 2030 and vision 2050 these are

the United Nations plans to depopulate the planet from 7.5 billion down to 500

million and then rule humanity under a communist one world government in the

year 2030 this is what the globalists want a world government will give the

globalist absolute control over all of the world's resources and population

out of these troubled times our fifth objective a new world order can emerge

and today that new world is struggling to be born a world quite different from

the one we've known a world where the rule of law supplants the rule of the jungle the opportunity to forge for

ourselves and for future generations a new world order a world where the rule

of law not the law of the jungle governs the conduct of nations when we are successful and we

will be we have a real chance at this new world order an order in which a

credible United Nations can use its peacekeeping role to fulfill the promise

and vision of the UN's founders what is at stake is more than one small

country it is a big idea a new world order where diverse

nations are drawn together in common cause to achieve the universal

aspirations of mankind and that's why I wanted to speak to you today about the new world taking shape

around us about the prospects for a new world order now

within our reach in the coming weeks I'll be talking in some detail about the

possibility of a new world order emerging after the cold war but today I

want to discuss another aspect of that order you see as the Cold War drew to an

end we saw the possibilities of a new order in which

nations work together it refers to new ways of working with other nations to

deter aggression and to achieve stability as old threats recede new

threats emerge the quest for the new world order is in part a challenge to

keep the dangers of disorder at bay we must build on the successes of

desert storm to give new shape and momentum to this new world order only

when this transformation is complete will we be able to take full measure of

the opportunities presented by this new and involving world order

but it is the awareness itself that will drive the change and

one of the ways it will drive the change is through global governance and global

agreements now much has been said by the secretary of state and others about a new world order about a defining moment

in history i have no doubt about the potential of this moment to be defining in terms of history but that definition

can be negative as well as positive and how negative or positive it will be will depend on what kind of new world order

we really create never before has a new world order had to be assembled from so

many different perceptions or on so global a scale

the great seal of the United States and that great seal of the United States has

on it novos order securum a new order

for the centuries for the ages forever there is a chance for the president of

the United States to use this disaster to carry out what his father a phrase

his father used I think only once and hasn't been used since and that is a new world order during the conflict of

Saddam Hussein which he handled so superbly in in a short-term sense he kept talking about a new world order uh

and and and then President Bush at the end of that that war promised he would give four graduation address and four

commencement addresses describing that new world order and what America's role was going to be in it turned out he gave

one of those addresses and cancelled the other talked about something else that's what they weren't and this present

window of opportunity during which a truly peaceful and interdependent world

order might be built will not be here for open for too long it it's it's past

the point of talking um we know historically that the global governance um sort of agenda um to these issues is

is is very hard to try and is is is with all the best intentions is very hard to actually activate um we're seeing that

right now now we're seeing a lot of fragmentation going on in Copenhagen a lot of different agendas pulling in different directions these measures are

enacted we continue to move forward with the G20 process we will have the kind of global government governance that is

necessary to ensure the stability and transparency of markets in a way that gives us the benefits of a globalized

market economy without the enormous risks that uh standing there with my people they were bombed and I was just

target like them and as elected president official in charge of their protection I couldn't do anything about

it but the point here is it's not about me it's about the idea of freedom it's

about the future of the whole region it's about the f of Europe and a new world

order the transatlantic partnership was never just the foundation of our

security it was the foundation of our way of life it was forged an experience of the most

bitter and anguished kind out of it came a new Europe a new

world order a new consensus as to how life should and could be

lived the pieces are in flux soon they will settle again before they

do let us reorder this world around us i think a new world order is emerging and

with it the foundations of a new and progressive era of international cooperation we have resolved that from

today we will together manage the process of globalization to secure

responsibility from all and fairness to all and we've agreed that in doing so we

will build a more sustainable and more open and a fairer global society

realizes what I believe is our destiny of success in this new world order so in

conclusion ladies and gentlemen a new world is emerging it is a new world order with

significantly different and radically new challenges maybe some people dreamt of at that conference back in

Bournemouth when it looked as if maybe history would end that liberal democracy would triumph that free market economics

would slowly progress and we'd have a new world order ted what do you think America's place in the new world order

should be it's always been seen as the global policeman but as you said before you know it's hard to see with all these

military conflicts where the winner and loser lies what What should America be doing i think a global policeman should

be the United Nations what sort of a financial deal should Obama be seeking to strike when he travels to China next

month no I think this would be the time because you really need to bring China

into the creation of a new uh uh uh world order financial world order uh

what do you think the most important thing is for Barack Obama obviously you're here to talk about uh the anniversary for US China diplomatic

relations but if you had to say this is going to be the country or the conflict or the place that will define the Obama

administration what would it be well the president-elect is coming into

office at the moment when there are upheavalss in many parts of the world simultaneously you have India

Pakistan you you have uh the jihadist

movement so he can't really say there is one problem that it's the most important one uh but he can give a new

impetus to American foreign policy partly because the reception of him is

so extraordinary around the world i think his task will be to develop an

overall strategy for America in this period when really a new world order can

be created it's a great opportunity it isn't just a crisis

there's a need for a new world order but it has different characteristics in different parts of of

the world the affirmative task we have now is uh is to actually um uh create uh

uh a new world order because the global order is changing again and the

institutions and rules that worked so well in the postw World War II era for decades they need to be strengthened so

let's leave them something to think about as they go home let them go home and say Mr sorrow said here are three

things we can do simply one well deal with the mo with the mortgage problem

reduce uh foreclosures uh recapitalize uh the

banks and and then work on a better world order where

we work together to resolve problems that confront humanity like global

warming at its core Agenda 21 is about control control over land natural

resources and entire populations it seeks to control the air by regulation

of carbon emissions the ground by sustainable development and the sea

through environmental regulations officially stated Agenda 21 is a

comprehensive plan of action to be taken globally nationally and locally by organizations of the United Nations

system governments and major groups in every area in which human impacts on the

environment because being human will always have an impact on the environment

agenda 21 paves the way for extraordinary UN control

when you boil it down there are nine basic tenants of Agenda 21 move citizens

off private land and into urban housing create vast wilderness spaces inhabited

by large carnivores eliminate cars and create walkable cities support chosen

private businesses with public funds for sustainable development make policy

decisions that favor the greater good over individuals drastically reduce the

use of power water and anything else that creates carbon pollution use

bureaucracies to make sweeping decisions outside of democratic processes increase

taxes fees and regulations and finally implement policies meant to incentivize

a reduced

population the world today has 6.8 billion people that's headed up to about 9 billion now if we do a really great

job on new vaccines healthc care reproductive health services we could

lower that by perhaps 10 or

15% controlling our every impact on the environment means controlling every aspect of our lives what we eat how we

travel where we live how we live but no is still an option

let me say one thing about choice there is no real choice they say freedom of choice you're given an illusion of

choice americans are meant to feel free by the exercise of meaningless choices

and we will make America great again and when we do America will be greater than

ever but here in America where there's supposed to be free choice there's less

choice if if Americans ever come to the conclusion that there's not much difference between Republican and Democrats and they never include

alternative choices in the coverage the Americans really are aren't exposed to a

true choice so we really have to fight former CIA operative head of the Bin

Laden tracking unit Michael Shaw michael both the British and the United States

uh have reportedly uh made it very clear to Israel they would uh they would

prefer that there be no military action taken uh what are your thoughts well

we're at least in the United States we're pretty helpless if the Israelis attack Iran the power of Apac and the

lobby here they own the Congress will will uh lead to our support for whatever the Israelis do I think well every

candidate for Congress at that time had a pledge they

were given a pledge to to sign and I was uh new on the scene and uh so the pledge

had Jerusalem as the capital city the eternal capital of the Jewish people

Jerusalem uh the military superiority of American Congress people have to sign this pledge

yes you sign the pledge if you don't sign the pledge you don't get money so for example it was almost like uh water

torture for me my parents observed this i would get a call and uh the person on

the other end of the phone would say "I want to do a fundraiser for you." And then we would get into the planning i

would get really excited because of course you have to have money in order to run a campaign and then 2 weeks 3

weeks into the planning they would say "Did you sign the pledge?" And then I

would say "No I didn't sign the pledge." And then my fundraiser would go "Kapoo."

I'm saying this to you right now israel gets approximately $15 billion a year

from the American taxpayers that 15 billion is $30,000 for every man woman

and child and people in my district are losing their pension benefits and I can't understand this why no one in

Congress is raising their voice and the reason is very simple and this may be

you don't want to hear i don't know and I certainly don't want to hurt you on your show you have one of the best

you're fair but I believe that Israel has a powerful strangle hold on the

American government they control both members of the House the House and the

Senate they have us involved in wars of which we have little or no interest our children are coming back in body bags

our nation is bankrupt over these wars and if you open your mouth you get targeted and if they don't beat you at

the pole they'll put you in prison they're controlling much of our

foreign policy they're influencing much of our domestic policy wolawitz's under

secretary of defense manipulated President Bush number two back into Iraq

they pushed definitely definitely to try and get Bush before he left to move into Iran we're conducting an expansionist

policy of Israel and everybody's afraid to say it they control much of the media

they control much of the commerce of the country and they control powerfully both

bodies of the Congress they own the Congress are you an anti-semite no I'm not that's exactly what they're going to

say and I expect that what I am is an American you see I think America comes first and we have a one-sided foreign

policy in the Middle East and we've alienated Arabs who have no way of fighting so what they've done and I

predicted this on the House floor is they would export violence to America and they have they have no other way to

fight greta I'm saying this America is in danger if America doesn't take back

the government without foreign influence i went into the state department um near

east section and found there was not one single

Palestinian not one single um Muslim religious

uh Saudi you know Jordanian not one Christian

Protestant not one Roman Catholic not one plain old

American whatever from Cornpone every single person in all of

those offices were either Zionist Israelis whatever and they had pictures

all over the wall of Israel Israel Israel they had magazines Israel today

you know I was given a copy of one um and there were yarmakas you know and

in the uh um Israeli writing in other

words and I I asked one of the women after having gone through about you know

four or five of these offices I said because I was pretending like I really you know wanted I was just kind of

wanting to know where where the Palestinian office was you know she said "Well we handle all of that we handle

all of that." And this is the State Department the

Near East the the part that handles Israel Jordan okay all of these Egypt

yeah the Near East section it was just totally dominated by totally

Israeli totally and at that time the spokesman I can't remember his name he

was a Zionist the spokesman for the whole state department i have the high

privilege and distinct honor of presenting to you the prime minister of Israel his excellency Benjamin Netanyahu

the world has gone mad there is no morals there is no loyalty there is no

where nothing everyone just do what you can listen to the government follow everybody like sheep be brainwashed by

all the Zionist Jewish people who own all the banks all the papers all the TV

stations be uh be brainwashed by all at a 1991 closed meeting of fellow

internationalists billionaire and former CFR chairman David Rockefeller praised

his media allies but his confidence that his words would not leave the room was

later broken we are grateful to the Washington Post the New York Times Time magazine and

other publications whose directors have attended our meetings and respected their promises of discretion for almost

40 years it would have been impossible for us to develop our plan for the world

if we had been subject to the rights of publicity that the world is now more sophisticated and prepared to march

toward a world government that these men aimed to create a world system of financial control in private hands able

to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole in short they seek total and

quiet control of the entire

world but we have to put our money where our mouths are

and we can only realize the promise of this institution's founding to replace the ravages of war

with cooperation if powerful nations like my own accept

constraints sometimes I'm criticized in my own country for professing a belief in

international norms and multilateral institutions but I am convinced that in the long run giving up some freedom of

action not giving up our ability to protect ourselves or pursue our core interests but binding ourselves to

international rules over the long term enhances our

security out of all the groups the most important one by a mile was the English

Defense League British Freedom Party that was a serious systematic hugely

funded effort by a section of the ruling elite by this Zionist neocon clique to

dominate to simply take over nationalism and turn it into their tool to encourage

the white working class to go and fight their wars and so that when the banking collapse comes people are looking in the

wrong direction instead of the real culprits this party we were approached I was approached we were offered money

from the United States and all they wanted was two things they only wanted us to concentrate on Islam and I yield

to no one in my criticism of Islam and grooming i put my neck on the line many

of you have put your neck on the line as well but it's not the only problem and they wanted us only to focus on that and

it only came with one other thing they wanted us to drop our criticism of the

banking system those were the only two things we had to concentrate on talking

about Muslims and we had to drop our criticism of the international banking

system 1984 is I believe a quite terrifying masterpiece so terrifying in

fact I don't think I should like to read another like it i am not absolutely dissatisfied with it

i think it is a good idea but the execution would have been better if I

had not been under the influence of TB when I wrote it you once claimed that you have an

ability to face unpleasant facts is that what you demonstrated in 1984 by drawing

an accurate portrait of the future i think that allowing for the book being

after all a parody something like 1984 could actually happen this is the

direction the world is going in at the present time in our world there will be no

emotions except fear rage triumph and

self-abasement the sex instinct will be eradicated there will be no loyalty except loyalty

to the party but always there will be the intoxication of

power always at every moment there will be the thrill of victory the sensation

of trampling on an enemy who is helpless if you want a picture of the

future imagine a boot stamping on a human face

forever the moral to be drawn from this dangerous nightmare situation is a

simple one don't let it happen it depends on you
