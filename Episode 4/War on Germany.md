in 1932 Bernard Lakash president of the World Jewish League said "Germany is our

public enemy number one it is our object to declare war without mercy against

her." In March of 1933 before the Germans had enacted any anti-Jewish laws

and before any hostilities against the Jews had taken place worldwide Jewish leaders officially issued a declaration

of war against Germany a worldwide Jewish boycott of German goods began

20,000 Jews protested at New York City Hall rallies and boycots were directed

against German goods samuel Unterme speaking on behalf of international jury

declared war on Germany with an economic boycott the front page of the March 24th

London Daily Express carried the headline "Jude declares war on Germany

jewish leaders were quoted as calling for a holy war against the German people

the Jewish wholesaler will quit his house the banker his stock exchange the

merchants his business and the beggar his humble hut in order to join the holy

war against Hitler's people the Express said that Germany was now confronted

with an international boycott of its trade its finances and its industry in

London New York Paris and Warsaw jewish businessmen are united to go on an

economic crusade in August of 1933 Samuel Untermire talked about a planned

annulation and extermination of Jews underway and also about a war that must

be waged against Germany to stop it in a hysterical radio broadcast Unto Mayo

called for the Jews to destroy Germany in a sacred war denouncing the Germans

as cruel savage beasts and ingrates untero claimed that the Germans were

annulating the Jews by locking them up in vile concentration camps starving and

torturing them murdering and beating them without cause and resorting to every other conceivable form of torture

inhuman beyond conception until suicide had become their only means of escape

and all solely because they are or their remote ancestors were Jews this was 1933

and Unterme was already talking about a holocaust well he must have had some supernatural mental

powers in a radio broadcast on WABC New York August 6 1933 Unero stated that

each of you Jew and Gentile alike who is not already enlisted in this holy war

should do so now and here it is not sufficient that you should buy no goods made in Germany you must refuse to deal

with any merchant or shopkeeper who sell any Germanmade goods or who patronizes

German ships or shipping we will undermine the Hitler regime and bring the German people to their senses by

destroying their export trade on which their very existence depends the boycott

of all German goods and services is our only remedy we've now most reluctantly

embarked upon a worldwide boycott in which we demand and are receiving the

wide support of men and women of all creeds and classes in all ages no more

holy war was ever waged in order to do their share of service this army of

civilization you have only to buy and use but to refuse to buy and use any

goods made in Germany or to patronize German ships or shipping

the new Germany that will break free from Jewish supremacism was declared to be an enemy of Jewish interest and thus

needed to be economically strangled again it is also important to note that this was before Hitler decided to

boycott Jewish goods many Jews in Germany and Palestine opposed the international boycott saying that it

would promote anti-Jewish violence within Germany these Jews supported the national socialist regime but the Jewish

supremacists did not care at all despite efforts by the German government to

alleviate tensions and prevent the escalation of name calling and threats by the international Jewish leadership

it continued the intensity of the Jewish campaign against Germany was such that Hitler stated that if the campaign did

not stop there would be a one-day boycott in Germany of Jewish owned stores despite this the hate campaign

continued forcing Germany to take defensive measures that created a situation wherein Jews became more and

more ostracized in a similar vein the Jewish newspaper Natasha Wretch wrote "The war against

Germany will be waged by all Jewish communities conferences congresses by

every individual Jew thereby war against Germany will be ideologically in living

and promote our interest which require that Germany be wholly destroyed." The

danger for us Jews lies in the whole German people in Germany as a whole as

well as individually he must be rendered harmless for all time in this war we

Jews have to participate and this with all the strength and might we have at our

disposal worldwide Jewish leadership with an iron grip of world media and press was now starting the massive

launch of propaganda against Germany that soon would escalate into World War

II it was in direct response to this that the German government finally

initiated a one-day boycott of the Jewish businesses after the Jews had

declared war on Germany dr joseph Gubbles announced that the one-day boycott would be lifted if anti-German

protests were suspended if the protest did not end Goubbles warned that the

anti-Jewish boycott would be resumed however this would not help the

worldwide Jewish boycott continued for

months vladimir Yabotinski which was a Jewish communist and a founder of the

Irun terrorist organization wrote in the January 1934 issue of Natasha Re the

fight against Germany has been carried on for months by every Jewish community conferences Congress trade organization

by every Jew in the world there is reason to believe that our part in the struggle will be of general value we

shall let loose a spiritual and material war of the whole world against Germany

germany's ambition is to become a great nation again to reconquer her lost territories and colonies our Jewish

interest on the other hand demand the complete destruction of Germany the German nation is collectively and

individually a danger to us david A brown national chairman of

the United Jewish Campaign 1934 said "We Jews are going to bring a war on

Germany." Shim Wiseman president of both the

International Jewish Agency and of the World Scionist Organization and later

Israel's first president stated in 1936 "It is no exag to say that 6 million

Jews are sentenced to be imprisoned in this part of the world where they are unwanted and for whom the countries are

divided into those where they are unwanted and those where they are not admitted." Emmy Ludvig Conn in 1938 said

Hitler does not want war but he will be forced to it and in fact soon England

has the final say like in 1914 henry Morgan thou secretary of the

US Treasury Hart's press September 1933 said war in Europe in

1934 was inevitable in 1938 the Jewish Declaration of War

against Germany was repeated the American people were urged by the Jewish owned press to boycott all German goods

and German businesses at the 1936 World Scionist

Conference Chime Wiseman said "Perhaps only 2 million will survive the upcoming

Holocaust but they will be ready for life in Palestine." Note that this was in

1936 a letter published by the Miami News on 12th July 1938 entitled "Kill

off the Germans," stated that nothing but the almost complete extermination of

the savage whites will ensure peace on earth and goodwill toward men jewish

professor Alexander Kulisher noted lawyer and scientist said on October 1937 "Germany is the enemy of Judaism

and must be pursued with deadly hatred the goal of Judaism of today is a

merciless campaign against all German peoples and the complete destruction of the nation we demand a complete blockade

of trade importation of raw materials stopped and retaliation towards every German woman and child

from 1923 to 1933 German nationalists were regularly

targeted by Jewish communists and terrorists 200 national socialists and

216 police officials were murdered by mainly Jewish communists 20,000 national

socialists and 1,976 police officers were injured

herbert Norcus a school boy and member of the Hitler Youth was brutally stabbed in six places horest Wessle a young

German student was shot the Swiss National Socialist leader Willham Gustlav was brutally murdered by the Jew

David Frankfurter in 1936 germans were outraged at the murders

the acts of terror against the German people went on for many years without an

end february 27th 1933 four weeks after Hitler's appointment as chancellor

communist terrorists set fire to the rich tag local police catched a Dutch

communist named Marinos Vander Luba the man who set fire to the rich tag the

fire was to have been the start of a red instigated civil war before Hitler and and his DAP could establish themselves

hindenburg and Hitler acted fast issued emergency decrees and communist leaders were arrested and sent to what later

would be called concentration camps most of the communists were Jews this is why media portrays it as a systematic

persecution against the Jews the night of the long knives also known

as Operation Hummingbird occurred in National Socialist Germany between June 30 and July the 2nd

1934 at least 85 individuals were executed and more than a thousand

arrested by the National Socialists the reason for this was that as a leader Erns Rem and others were planning a coup

against the Germans the actions by Hitler was to prevent another communist revolution

taking place in Germany the purge strengthened and consolidated the support of the army leaders for Hitler

on November 9th 1938 a Polish Jew named Hershel Ginspan reached the German

embassy asking to speak to a member of the diplomatic staff when Erns von Raf a

29-year-old German diplomat positioned in Paris came to greet the visitor Grimben picked up his pistol and

murdered him in cold blood this was the straw that broke the camel's back the

Germans now had enough of Jewish inspired boycots slanders wararmongering and murders aimed at them the news of

the murder triggered riots torching and vandalism directed at Jewish and communist shops and businesses the riots

were not sanctioned by any official NSDAP member and it was an angry Gbles who ordered the violence to stop

instantly and it stopped after the first night gubbles was at the time negotiating to overturn the

international Jewish embargo and feared that the violence would derail the talks early in the morning following the

crystal knocked events Gubbles announced in a radio broadcast that any action against Jews was strictly prohibited and

warned of severe penalties for disobeying this order he complained that he would now have to explain this

terrible affair to the German people in the world and that he simply did not know what kind of credible explanation

to give hitler was also furious when he first heard about it and ordered the TX message to be sent to Galatier offices

which read "By express order from the very highest authority arson against Jewish businesses or other property must

in no case and under no circumstances take place." Several people were also arrested for

violence against Jews the night of violence referred to by Jews as crystal

night of the broken glass is often mentioned in Western media and in our school books as crazy spontanic

anti-semitic riots but the repeated terror psychological warfare agitation

boycots and murders which actually provoked German resentment are never

ever mentioned in our history books after the Jewish declaration of

war on Germany in 1933 German officials compromised and made a deal in secret

negotiations with the Palestine Center of the World Scionist Organization which would allow German Jews and their assets

to go to Palestine that deal was called the transfer agreement or the Havara

agreement this pact enabled thousands of Jews to migrate to Palestine with their wealth intact the immigration was a

lawfully conducted and regulated matter and not some kind of wild flight it was an attempt to peacefully resolve the

conflicts between the Jews and the Germans so that they both could live in peace again each Jew destined for

Palestine deposited money in a special account in Germany the money was then used to buy German-made agricultural

tools building materials pumps and fertilizers etc which were exported to

Palestine and sold there by the Jewishowned Havara company in Tel Aviv money from the sale was then given to

the Jewish immigrant upon his arrival in Palestine in an amount corresponding to his deposit in

Germany the agreement thus served the Zionist aim of bringing the Jewish people and assets to Palestine while

simultaneously serving the German goal of reducing Jewish influence in Germany thus Hitler supported the Jewish

immigration to Palestine in eastern countries from 1933 until 1941 when the

war prevented further collaboration by the time World War II broke out Israel's economy would have half of a trillion

dollars worth of assets shipped from Germany via the Havara Agreement [Music]

meanwhile in the US the years between 1929 and 1939 2 million Mexicans were

also deported to Mexico as first authorized by President Herbert Hoover

of those 1.2 million actually were born American citizens

hitler's final solution to the Jewish problem was creating a homeland for the Jews on the beautiful island of

Madagascar of the coast of southern Africa and resettle 1 million Jews per year under German protection and

supervision the idea of a Jewish homeland of Madagascar had actually been circulated throughout Europe since the

1880s the national socialists worked out a plan going into detail for the

evacuation of the Jews to Madagascar and for the settlement there essor General

Hydridge submitted this plan directly to the right foreign minister in August

1940 the Madagascar plan was unfortunately scrapped when the British invaded the island in 1942 taking

control away from the Vichy France after the battle of Madagascar a Jewish Madagascar would have been a

win-win solution for Jews and Europeans and would have spared the poor Palestinians and other Arab nations all

of the horrors and wars they would endure after the founding of Israel in 1948 for centuries Europeans and Jews

have had problems living together the Jews have been expelled from over 100

nations before this expulsion was not something new every single nation with

the Jews were given full rights and privileges they had exploited and morally corrupted the host nation

defiled the Gentiles and then created uproars against themselves the Jewish

supremacists have of course always been able to put a blame on quote unquote anti-semitism

the National Socialists want the Jews to leave Germany and the Zionists wanted

the Jews to come to Palestine to help create the Sinist state the National Socialists held a

conference in Wansi one of the suburbs of Berlin on 20th January 1942 where it

was decided on the final solution of the Jewish problem the original document from the meeting is actually available

on the internet and nowhere does it say anything about killing the Jews the meeting discussed neither gas chambers

shootings nor any of other extermination methods there was never a final solution plan

that that's one of the one of the the falsehoods that that floats around just because the Nazis had used the term

final solution both in the years before the war and and at the beginning of the war doesn't mean they ever actually

drafted a plan even the minutes of the meeting the minutes that were taken of

the Vonce conference quite clearly state that the Jews at one point will be released so there was no talk of any

final solution plan there there was simply a talk of well well now that the Eastern Front is kind of stalled we've

got to figure out what to do with these many millions of Jews that we now have

in our custody that was a problem the Nazis did feel the need to deal with uh but not by creating one giant

overreaching plan the purpose of the WC conference was to discuss and plan how Europe's Jews would be deported to the

east some Jews would remain in Germany to work with road and construction and more they also decided that Jews who

participated in the first world war all of which were over 65 years old and all who worked in the industries would

remain in Germany this has also been confirmed by Yehuda Bower professor of holocaust studies in Abraham Harmon

Institute of Contemporary Yuri in Hebrew University of Jerusalem transit camps

were also created in Poland to facilitate the immigration of Jews the term

endra final solution of the Jewish question was the phrase used by the national socialists regarding the

alvandarum immigration and evacuum evacuation of Jews in occupied Europe to

the east Palestine and Madagascar the first to use the term however were

actually the scientists the final solution of the Jewish question is in fact a direct quote from the 1897

scientist manifesto the infamous phrase was being used by leading scientist long

before NSDAP even existed in 1897 the National Jewish Association Cologne

published its program called thesis experience has shown that civic emancipation has fallen short of

securing the social and cultural future of the Jewish people the final solution of the Jewish question lies therefore in

the establishment of the Jewish state in 1897 the Roshell founded the Sinist

Congress and arranged its first meeting in Munich this was rearranged in Basil Switzerland this gathering was led by

the father of Zionism Theodore Herzel and in 1899 he proposed the final

solution of the Jewish question and proposed liquidation of Jewish wealth it

is essential that the suffering of Jews become worse this will assist us in the realization of our plans i have an

excellent idea i shall induce anti-semites to liquidate Jewish wealth

the anti-semites will assist us thereby in that they will strengthen the persecution and oppression of Jews the

anti-semites shall be our best friends herzel also used the term the final

solution of the Jewish question in an 1899 letter to the Russians SAR i owe my

permission to submit the scientist plan for the final solution of the Jewish

question the scientist Nahim Sokulov wrote in his 1919 book history of scanism that the

progress of modern civilization has come to be regarded as some sort of modern messiah for the final solution of the

Jewish problem ricard James Huratio Gothal was

the son of a rabbi and the president of the American Federation of Zionists he said assimilation of the Jews must not

be the final solution of the Jewish question the Jewish yearbook of

5,676 states that the British Jews adopted a policy for the final solution

of the Jewish question even in 1940 a Jewish magazine article quoting Trosky

mentioned the final solution of the Jewish question

israeli lawyer diplomat and scientist Ari Leon Kubovi said there exists no

document signed by Hitler Himmler or Hadrish speaking of exterminating the Jews the word extermination does not

appear in the letter from Gering to Hydrish concerning the final solution of the Jewish question

hitler's main goal was to fix the problems of the Versile Treaty and to take back the stolen German territory to

unite all Germans into the Third Reich as early as in 1923 Hitler said in his

speech "So long as this treaty stands there can be no resurrection of the German people no social reform of any

kind is possible." The treaty was made in order to bring 20 million Germans to their deaths and to ruin the German

nation what politically correct historians failed to mention or deliberately cover up is the fact that

Hitler actually made several documented attempts in an effort to avoid World War II however each of these peace offerings

were rejected by those who would gain from a war with Germany on 17th of May

1933 Hitler delivered a speech declaring that Germany was willing to disarm if the neighboring countries would

reciprocate the proposal was rejected instead the other countries continued filling up their arsenals with weapons

piling up their stores of explosives and increasing the numbers of their troops the League of Nations the globalist

instrument of the victorious powers forced Germany through a period of probation before it would be possible to

discuss the disarmament of the other countries thus on October 14th 1933

Hitler broke away from the Globalist League of Nations with which it was impossible to come to any agreement on

18th of December 1933 Hitler submitted a six-point proposal for the improvement of international relations on 26th of

January 1934 Hitler completed a non-aggression pact with Poland the danger to the right was now so great

that Hitler reintroduced conscription on March 16th 1935 on 1st of March 1935 Hitler assured

France on every possible occasion of his desire to live at peace with her on 21st of May 1935 Hitler made another attempt

to avoid the growing possibility of war on 18th of June 1935 Hitler negotiated a

naval agreement with Great Britain on 31st of March 1936 Hitler formulated a

comprehensive plan for peace this peace plan could have been a genuine turning point for the prosperity of all nations

in Europe

[Music] the Anelus was the voluntary unification of Austria into the German Reich the

Versal treaty had broken up the AustriaHungarian Empire and denied the new Austria from uniting with Germany

but after seeing the great success of Hitler's Germany there was no stopping the Austrians desire to unite with their

joyful brothers and sisters an overwhelming 99% of Austrian citizens

voted to reunite with their Germanic brothers without a shot being fired on

the morning of 12th of March 1938 German forces crossed the border near Hitler's

birthplace of Branau and were greeted as saviors and liberators by the joyous Austrians as a brotherly gesture towards

the Austrians and a sign to the rest of the world of a peaceful reunion Hitler invited Austrian troops to march inside

of Germany as well not surprisingly the Western globalist media portrayed the joyful unification as Germany invaded

and conquered Austria austria was still in the depression when Hitler unified the both countries with the help of

Germany this problem was turned around border was restored and within 2 years there was full employment

the German people of Czechoslovakia share the same desire to reunite Germany

when the Treaty of Versail ripped AustriaHungary to pieces it combined shecks Sloaks Germans and Hungarians

into an artificial state called Czechoslovakia prague and Bohemia have been part of Germany for centuries the

Prague regime represented a grave threat to Germany czechoslovakia's communist

president Beans had been ordered by his Kremlin masters to open his borders to the communist armies at a moment's

notice to start of a war against Germany prague was going to be the Soviet springboard to Germany the German region

Sudentinland abide south of Germany had 3.5 million citizens just as the

Austrians the Sudantinlanders wish to unite with Germany but Czechoslovakia's communist president Edward Baines would

not allow it the Sudentan landers were already seriously mistreated by the communist state of Czeoslovakia to end

this on 15th of March 1939 German troops entered into Czechoslovakia later that

same day Hitler was in Prague with his troops to resolve the matter peacefully Hitler called for an emergency

conference in Munich with Italy France and England all agreed that the German Sudentan land would be unified with

Germany and that the Slovaks would have their own state called Slovak Republic the Sudentan Germans were returned to

German rule just as they wished truly a win-win situation as when arriving in Austria

Hitler also received the hero's welcome upon visiting the Sudentan land chambellain returned from Munich to a

blissful response waving a paper he and Hitler had signed and declared "For the second time in our history a British

prime minister has returned from Germany bringing peace with honor i believe it is peace for our time." December 1938

Hitler instructed the German foreign minister to make an agreement with

France after World War I the Allies had cut up German territory and given part

of Germany Western Prussia to the newly reestablished nation of Poland eastern

Prussia was totally left cut off and isolated from Germany the Treaty of Versal had separated the German city of

Danik from Germany and given it to Poland against the wish of its citizens

political scientist Stefan Wolf professor at the University of Birmingham says that the actions of

Polish state officials after the corridor's establishment followed a course of assimilation and oppression as

a result a large amount of ethnic Germans left Poland after the First World War the contemporary German

statisticians say 592,000 Germans had left by 1921 and

other Polish scholars say that up to a million Germans left that free city of

Dansik was over 90% German and had since 1871 belonged to Germany the city with a

predominantly German-speaking population along with its surrounding German area of East Prussia Danzig was isolated from

the German mainland by the Versile Treaty with formerly German territory now belonging to Poland cutting right

through the Prussian Pomeranian region of Germany contrary to popular belief Hitler did not hold a grudge against

Poles in fact he was profoundly impressed by the Polish victory in the Polish Soviet war 1919 to 1921

hitler wanted the kind of alliance with Poland he had with Italy and if he could he would have teamed up with the Polish

people to defend Europe from communism marshall Joseph Pilotski was a leader of

Poland up until his death in 1935 he was idolized by Hitler in 1934 a

peace pact was signed between Adolf Hitler and Pisutski ensuring peace between the two nations it made good

sense that Poland should participate in a defense wall against boleeism said Hitler every Polish division would mean

strengthening the military power against not only a possible but now already significantly obvious onslaught of

bulsheism against Europe all anti-Polish propaganda was now banned by Hitler in a right tag

speech May 21st 1935 Hitler said "We recognize with the understanding and the

heartfelt friendship of true nationalists the Polish state as the home of a great nationally conscious

people." According to this non-aggression pact both countries pledged to resolve their problems

through negotiations not armed conflict unfortunately Pilotsky died on 12th of

May 1935 and peace negotiations fell through in Germany flags were now flown

half masked hitler was truly saddened by Pilotski's death and he even wrote a letter to his

wife the sudden death of the Polish leader was very bad news for Germany the

popular marshall was succeeded by the Marshall Edward Ritz Smiggley pilotski's

death and Smiggler's rise was to be great setbacks for Germany smiggley was

not interested in peace with Germany and he instead signed the Polish British common defense pact that promised of

British military assistance in a situation if Poland would be attacked by another European country america's

Jewish Secretary of Treasury Henry Morgan thou Jr telephoned the Jewish French politician Leon Bloom and

suggested freezing German bank accounts in France in hopes of pushing France into a war with Germany on October 1938

Poland's dictator Smiggley demanded a portion of Salzi and some other smaller Czech areas the Polish army enex the

areas with a population of 227,399 people and Polish tanks rolled

into the enexed Czech territory the shecks were too powerless to stop the forced

annexations on 16th of March 1939 supposedly neutral Roosevelt sent an

ultimatum to Britain demanding that hereafter the British government would strongly oppose Germany maps now started

to circulate showing a new western Polish border extending to just west of Berlin german newspapers and politicians

like Adolf Hitler now accused Polish authorities of organizing and tolerating

violent ethnic cleansing of ethnic Germans living in Poland on 25th of April 1939 the Jewish

diplomat journalist and novelist William Bullet called American newspapers columnist Carl von Vgard chief European

correspondent of the international news service to the American embassy in Paris and told him "War Europe has been

decided upon poland has the assurance of the support of Britain and France and will yield to no demands from Germany

america will be in the war soon after Britain and France enter it." In a

secret conversation at Hyde Park on 28th of May 1939 Roosevelt assured the

communist former president of Czechoslovakia Dr edward Beans that America would actively intervene on the

side of Britain and France in the anticipated European war count Jertzie Potaki was the Polish

ambassador to USA he explained in 1934 that above all propaganda here is

entirely in Jewish hands when bearing public ignorance in mind their propaganda is so effective that people

have no real knowledge of the true state of affairs in Europe president Roosevelt has been given power to create huge

reserves and armaments for a future war which the Jews are deliberately heading

for in a report from Washington back to the foreign minister in Warsaw dated 9th

of February 1939 he wrote "The pressure of the Jews on President Roosevelt and

on the State Department is becoming ever more powerful the Jews are right now the

leaders in creating a war psychosis which would plunge the entire world into

war and bring about general catastrophe this mood is becoming more and more

apparent in their definition of democratic states the Jews have also

created real chaos they have mixed together the idea of democracy and communism and have above all raised the

banner on burning hatred against Nazism this hatred has become a frenzy it is

propagated everywhere and by every means in theaters in the cinema and in the press the Germans are portrayed as a

nation living under the arrogance of Hitler which wants to conquer the whole world and drown all humanity in an ocean

of blood in conversations with Jewish press representatives I have repeatedly come up against the inexorable and

convinced view that war is inevitable this international jury exploits every

means of propaganda to oppose any tendency towards any kind of consolidation and understanding between

nations in this way the conviction is growing steadily but surely in public

opinion here that the Germans and their satellites in the form of fascism are enemies who must be subdued by the

democratic world in a diary entry of July 6th 1939 he said "In the West there

were all kinds of elements openly pushing for war the Jews the super capitalist the arm dealers today they

are all ready for a great business because they have found a place which they can set on fire Dansik and a nation

that is ready to fight Poland they want to do business on our backs they are

indifferent to the destruction of our country indeed since everything will have to be rebuilt later on they can

profit from that as well as before the Germans in Poland were a persecuted

minority deprived of all rights just as with the Germans stranded in Czechoslovakia between 1919 to 1939

Germany was repeatedly attacked by Polish partisans working for Jewish or

communist interests there were already 80,000 ethnic Germans

in refugee camps in both Danik and the German

[Music] Reich irish defector to Germany William

Joyce explained "German men and women were hunted like wild beasts through the streets of Bramberg when they were

caught they were mutilated and torn to pieces by the Polish mob every day the

butchery increased thousands of Germans fled from their homes in Poland with nothing more than the clothes that they

wore on the nights of August 25th to August 31st inclusive there occurred

besides innumerable attacks on civilians of German blood 44 perfectly

authenticated acts of armed violence against German official persons and property there were 12,857

identified dead in the Bramberg area leaving a large number of unidentified

dead there and many more dead elsewhere both Hogan and Worerm War Crimes Bureau

agree with these conclusions these historical facts were also confirmed by the East German historian

Theodore Beers in 1954 and the social democratic journalist Otto Hike in 1955

on the basis of Polish documents george Oio said "I lived in

Germany during the 1980s when many people who lived during the war were still alive i sought out anyone who

lived near Poland in 1939 and was lucky enough to meet several people one was a

customs official who said it was so bad on the border they were armed and also had grenades in their office ready for

attacks another told me his farm animals were often stolen by Polish terrorists

another told of his knees being raped by a Pole who crossed the border this is just one of many stories told to me by

German civilians who witnessed these border incursions just like had happened in 1919 to 1928

one thing many people failed to see is that Poland openly attacked Germany

right after World War I which led to many border battles once Germany started

pressing Poland to work out a solution to the corridor the attack started again and one thing that is clear to me is

that Germany did not make up these attacks

to resolve the problems Hitler made numerous practical proposals which included the militarization of the key

port areas public referendum accepting Gdinia as a Polish port city on the

Baltic Sea 1 kilometer wide rail and road passage to link Eastern Prussia to

Germany or to link Poland to the Baltic Sea the anti-com pact would also be

signed to protect Poland from communist subversion every single German proposal

was ignored the widely disliked Polish Minister of Foreign Affairs Joseph Beck

refused every single German proposal after this German propaganda

would turn against Poland both Britain and France openly approached Stalin's

genocidal bolevist regime with the hopes of restoring a new version of the triple

intent alliance that had created the two-front world war I against Germany

rid Smiggle the new dictator of Poland was selected by the globalists to pick a fight with Germany for Britain and

France to then attack Germany from the east in defense of Poland and finally for the Soviet Union to then join the

fight against Germany from the east this planned aggression strategy towards Germany was being discussed openly and

in mainstream media for example as early as 1938 in a book titled A New Holy

Alliance by well-known Jewish writer Emil Ludvik born Emil Conn in the book

he called for a rebirth of the exact same two-front military alliance that two decades earlier had been plotted

against Germany UK France US Russia the

highly influential globalist New York-based Council on Foreign Relations

in its magazine Foreign Affairs carried a favorable review for Ludvig's book in

which the possibility of creating a two-front alliance was openly confirmed enmir Ludwig said "Even if

Hitler at the last moment would want to avoid war which would destroy him he

will in spite of his wishes be compelled to wage war." Hitler saw right through

this transparent game and consequently reached out to Stalin on 23rd of August

1939 Hitler signed the German Soviet non-aggression pact also known as the Molotov Ribbon Pact this was done to

hinder the wararmongering western allies by neutralizing their new triple intent

with Soviets hitler did not want a two-front war and the temporary alliance

with Stalin was done out of hopes that the British would not dare to declare war even after the pact was signed

Hitler still tried to avoid any war by reaching out to the Allies for talks which they refused to engage in every

time hitler even wrote a heartfelt letter to French President Daladir just

days after Ribbon Trump and Molotov was a finished deal in Moscow already in October 1930 the

influential Polish newspaper the Lia de Gmach carried the following declaration

a struggle between Poland and Germany is inevitable we must prepare oursel for it

systematically the defeat of Germany must be produced by Polish troops in the center of the territory in order to

strike Germany to the heart in a war with Germany there will be no prisoners and there will be no room neither for

human feelings nor cultural sentiments the world will tremble before the German Polish war we will evoke in our soldiers

a superhuman mood of sacrifice and spirit of merciless revenge and cruelty

the Warsaw newspaper Depes on 20th of August 1939 carried out the following

message we are ready to make a contract with the devil if he helps us fighting against Hitler listen against Germany

not only against Hitler the German blood will be spilled in a future war in such

streams like it wasn't seen since the beginning of the world poland's Marshall Rid Smiggly said in the Daily Mail 6th

of August 1939 that Poland wants war with Germany and Germany will not be

able to avoid it even if she wants to the Polish ambassador in Paris said on

15th of August 1939 "It will be a Polish army that will invade Germany on the

first day of war." Lord Beverbuk was the top newspaper module in Great Britain his Daily Express was the most read

newspaper in the world at the time in a private letter written in March 1938 he wrote "There are 20,000 German Jews in

England in the professions pursuing research they all work against an accommodation with Germany the Jews have

got a big position in the press here at least I am shaken the Jews may drive us

into war hitler finally declared to British Ambassador Sir Neville Henderson on

August 25th 1939 poland's provocations have become intolerable

polish officials were encouraged to attack Germany by the promises of British ambassador Sir Howard William

Kennard and French ambassador Leo Newell they had promised that Britain and France would come to Poland's immediate

aid if Germany would attack hitler mentioned over 30 border

violations for August alone in his Rtag speech on the 1st of September

1939 during the last weeks of August 1939 Germans were openly terrorized in

villages with the expression "Slaughter them off." Racial propaganda in the

Polish mainly Jewish owned press played a major role in the persecution of the

ethnic Germans the attacks reached their climax

on September the 3rd in Bramberg in what is known as the bloody Sunday the Polish

military gave full support to the Polish civilians and partisans hunting down

slaughtering the remaining German minorities still left in Poland in the standard communist practice the German

population was hunted down the houses were surged and ethnic Germans were beaten and raped they were usually

herded together driven off and massacred in isolated spots in numbers reaching from 39 48 53 to 104 at a time at least

5,500 were slaughtered like pigs children were nailed to barns women were raped and hacked to death with axes men

were beaten and hacked to death 328 Germans were herded into Bramberg's Protestant church after which the church

was set on fire all 328 burned to death the massacres in the city of Bramberg

would be hidden from our history books today these massacres have turned out to be one of the most monstrous and brutal

of crimes to ever be inflicted on a civilian population leandra Grail said "Of all

the crimes of World War II one never hears about the wholesale massacres that

occurred in Poland just before the war thousands of German men women and children were massacred in the most

horrendous fashion by pressed mobs hitler decided to halt the slaughter and

he rushed to the rescue germany finally retaliated on the 1st of September 1939 the same day

Dansik was formally captured by Germany germany invaded Poland and reclaimed the territories that had been taken away

from her by the Versal [Music]

i am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10 Downing

Street this morning the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German

government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by

11:00 that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland a

state of war would exist between us i have to tell you now that no such

undertaking has been received and that consequently this

country is at war with [Music]

Germany liberated Germans welcomed Hitler to Donsik as a hero after having

blocked the path to any peaceful discussion for 7 years prior to the war

Britain and France declared war on Germany on September the 3rd 1939 on the

5th of September the first bomb was dropped on German soil by the Royal Air Force the Soviet Union then invaded

Poland from the east and massacred tens of thousands of innocent Poles but the Allies said nothing the Allies only used

Poland as a dummy to start the war churchill would even give over Poland and the whole of Eastern Europe to

Soviet after the war the French actually invaded Germany on September the 7th the

German army now reinforced with troops returning from the Polish campaign conducted a counter offensive which took

back the lost territory from the invading French in liberating what the French had invaded the German lost 196

soldiers plus 114 missing and 356 wounded on September 17th 1939 the

German Polish War was already over hitler's mission had already been accomplished if Great Britain and France

would not have declared war the war would have been stopped right there and millions of lives would have been saved

however Britain had plans of a long war and they did not want peace the quiet

period between the end of the Polish war until May 1940 is called the Phony War

during this period Germany continued negotiating for

peace british Duke Arthur Willisley fifth Duke of Wellington said "This

declaration of war is the fault of the anti-appeasers and the [ __ ]

Jews." During his speech on October the 6th 1939 Hitler pleaded for peace once

again he said "At no time and in no place have I ever acted contrary to British interest i believe even today

that there can only be real peace in Europe and throughout the world if Germany and England come to an

understanding the majority of Poles understood that the Germans were not their real enemies and had no hand in

the game whatsoever the border conflicts were instigated by the Polish or Jewish

partisans encouraged by the Jewish own press and the Polish dictator Smiggley working in close cooperation with

Roosevelt a collection of secret Polish documents which fell into German hands when Warsaw

was captured in September 1939 clearly established Roosevelt's crucial role in

bringing on the Second World War they also revealed the forces behind Roosevelt which pushed for

war in September 1939 Adah Fitler said "Time and time again have I offered

friendship and if necessary closest cooperation to England but love cannot

be offered from one side only it must be met with reciprocation by the other side

germany is not pursuing any interest in the West." In October 1939 Hitler proclaimed in his

speech of a new peace proposal to prevent more Europeans being killed in a

senseless war if the Allied powers wanted peace they would long ago have

taken the hand that was stretched out to them but no the fate of this plan was the exact same as that of all the other

previous appeals made by Hitler no

response on the 4th of November 1939 Roosevelt and his Jewish advisor Bernard

Baroo instead decided to repeal previous neutrality acts to be able to sell arms

to waring nations and to soon enter a new war against Germany the Daily Herald

said in December 1939 "Stop talking about peace conditions break Germany in

the allies planned of invading Norway and Sweden attacking to cut off Germany's iron ore resources from Sweden

by illegally mining Norwegian waters and then occupying the important Norwegian

port of Narvik on 8th of April 1940 Britain violated Norwegian neutrality by

mining Norwegian waters plans were also made for building a base of operations

in Denmark Germany's neutral neighbor to its north these allied plans were called

Operation Wilfred and Plan R4 the Norwegian politician named Vidconistling

confirmed the existence of these allied plots quistling had served in the military from 1911 until the mid20s

specializing in Russian affairs he was stationed in Russia and saw the Bolevik plague firsthand in 1929 he returned to

Norway and served as a diplomat and later minister of defense for two governments in 1930 he wrote Russia and

Ourselves where he spoke of the dangers of bulcheism in 1933 he founded enough

saming national unity party to save Norway from the threat of communism on

Ada Fitler's 50th birthday Quistling sent him a card thanking him for saving Europe from bulcheism and Jewish

domination hitler told Quistling "After making one proposal after another to the British on

the reorganization of Europe I now find myself forced against my will to fight this war against Britain." Quistling who

was sympathetic to Germany did not want his country to become a battlefield so he informed Hitler of the plot to wage

war from the two Scandinavian countries in the early morning on the 9th of April 1940 Germany therefore quickly put

Operation Vesturboom into action and came to secure Denmark and then the Norwegian port of Narwig just before the

British could place their minds this was a preventive maneuver against the planned Allied operation Wilfred and

Plan R4 thus Hitler prevented the UK from using Norway and Denmark as basis

of operation against German shipping german diplomats calmly assured the leaders of both Scandinavian nations

that Germany seeks neither conquest nor interference in their internal affairs

the Germans dropped leaflets over Denmark which explained their actions condemned anti-German British

wararmongering and propaganda and reassured the Danes that Germany would protect their country life under limited

German occupation went on without any problems for the Scandinavians during the war and most of the Nordic people

were happy that they were protected by the Germans hitler's pleads for peace was repeatedly ignored as British and

French troops had massed in northern France plans were openly discussed to advance eastward upon Germany via

Belgium and Holland as another preemptive act of national self-defense Germany took the fight to the Allies

before the Allies could invade Germany and reinstitute a second Versal treaty on her the armies of Britain and France

were no match for the new tactic called Blitzkrieg to Britain and France who anticipated fighting in the trenches

like they did in the First World War this new German war machine came as a surprise they could not handle the

Germans quickly seized vital territory and resources which outflanked and trapped the Allies on the coast of

France hitler invaded the League of Nation member states of Belgium and the Netherlands for their strategic location

and for collaborating with the Allies the low count's governments were under intense Allied pressure to allow safe

passage for the planned Allied attack on the rural region of Germany the German

government later published a 50-page English language paper called Allied intrigue in the low countries which was

detailing the full extent of their cooperation with the Allies explaining why the Germans invade the Lo countries

strategically the western press and the modern historians have kept these allegations secret from the public ever

since jewishowned press as well as today's history books instead portray the blitz as the Nazi conquest of

Holland Belgium and France churchill's colleague Alfred Dof Cooper said "War to

death against all German people." Lord Beverbuk wrote to Frank Ganet in

December 1938 the Jews are after Prime Minister Chamberlain he is being

terribly harassed by them all the Jews are against him they have got a big position in the press here i am shaken

the Jews may drive us into war and their political influence is moving us in that direction on the 10th of May 1940

Chamblain resigned and Winston Churchill came to power without the consent of the people churchill was born on November 30

1874 into the aristocracy of Great Britain he joined the army and wrote popular books about his military

adventures churchill was a supporter of eugenics and introduced the Mental Deficiency Act that required those with

mental disabilities to be confined to institutions for the duration of their lives though he originally wanted

sterilization he also introduced the People's Budget which increased taxes on the wealthy in order to fund social

programs he helped set up his country's first minimum wage and pensions for the unemployed he was behind the National

Insurance Act which provided sickness and unemployment benefits the same day

that he came to power Churchill invaded the tiny neutral Iceland in the invasion code named Operation Fork iceland was a

neutral country but that really didn't seem to matter the occupation would help to secure British control of the

Atlantic the British quickly moved inland disabling communication networks and securing landing locations the

government of Iceland protested the violation of their neutrality icelandic police officers wanted to stop the

British invasion but they later decided not to resist the superior British force the US intended to use neutral Iceland

as a base of naval operations in the North Atlantic many men from Iceland instead volunteered to fight for the

Vafanesses

on 24th of May 1940 at Dunkerk Hitler had the opportunity to capture the

entire British army but chose not to instead he issued the so-called halt

order and delayed the attack for 2 days leaving the British time for a chaotic

evacuation from the port of Dunkerk hoping that the British finally would lay down their weapons and so they could

have peace almost everyone saw this as a gesture of peace all heavy artillery tanks and armored vehicles were left on

the shores of France german General Von Blumenred said "With regard to the halt

order Hitler then astonished us by speaking with admiration of the British Empire of the necessity for its

existence and of the civilization that Britain had brought into the world." He compared the British Empire with the

Catholic Church saying they were both essential elements of stability in the world he said that all he wanted from

Britain was that she should acknowledge Germany's position on the continent the return of Germany's colonies would be

desirable but not essential and he would even offer to support Britain with troops if she should be involved in

difficulties anywhere churchill was now too drunk to deliver speeches himself so drunk in

fact that he hired the actor Normous Shelley who voiced the Winnie the Pooh for the BBC Children's Hour to

impersonate him he made the most famous radio speeches in 20th century British

history impersonating Churchill and fooled tens of millions of

listeners after 6 weeks of German blitzkrieg Paris was Hitler's hitler and Field Marshal Kain made peace the

armistice was signed in the same railway car in which Germany surrendered after World War I after the delegations were

done Hitler went home to Berlin where he was welcomed home as a national

hero a life in northern France went on peacefully for the French civilians during the temporary wartime German

occupation of 1940 to 1944 the manners of the German occupiers was impeccable

many French women even fell in love with German soldiers

[Music]

that same day Hitler via a Swedish third party presented Britain with yet another

offer of peace the Germans contacted the British ambassador in Sweden Victor Mallet through Sweden's Supreme Court

judge who is known to Hitler's legal advisor Ludvik Visar hitler's new peace

proposal was as following the British Empire retains all its colonies germany's position on the continent will

not be questioned all questions concerning the Mediterranean and its French Belgian and Dutch colonies are

open to discussion poland a Polish state must exist the former Czechoslovakian

state remain independent but under German protection hitler's peace proposal demanded nothing of Great

Britain and entails that the states currently occupied by Germany would be deoccupied as Germany's occupation was

only provisional due to the present war situation but no Winston Churchill was

not interested in making peace this offer was rejected thanks to Churchill

German peace efforts via Sweden also failed in the afternoon of 25th of May

1940 Guspe Bastanini the Italian ambassador in London requested a meeting

with British foreign secretary Lord Halifax to discuss Italy's neutrality and that of Italian mediation between

the allies and Germany bastianini revealed that the goal of the Italian Benito Mussolini was to negotiate a

settlement that would not merely be an armistice but would protect European peace for the century halifax responded

favorably to it and took the idea to the British war cabinet where he summarized his meeting with Bastianini and urged

his college to consider Italian mediation again Churchill will have none of it as he was not interested in making

peace never even once did Churchill consider Mussolini's offer to mediate

peace between Britain and Germany the matter eventually died thanks to Churchill German peace offers via Italy

also failed instead of accepting any peace offers Churchill answered with

frightening the British people with fear-mongering tales of a coming German gas

attack a month after England evacuated Dunkirk and the Axis victory against France Hitler extended his hand one

final time to end the meaningless bloodshed i had the occasion to talk to

him without any other company and I told him we will have the

opportunity to attack London when London is covered by phone and we can fly with

everything we have available even with the junk 52 like we did in

Wazu and he said stop it stop it I don't want to hear

this the whole attack on England is against my opinion against my willing i

would like I could stop it the English population is of such high class and

they are so similar to the Germans that I hate to fight England

in June 1940 Hitler dropped peace leaflets over London in this hour I feel

it to be my duty before my own conscience to appeal once more to reason and common sense in Great Britain as

much as elsewhere i see no reason why this war must go on i am grieved to

think of the sacrifices it will claim i should like to avert them pamphlets and speeches where Hitler

offered peace proposal after peace proposals were not enough churchill and

his Jewish adviserss wanted

war hitler also held close correspondence with Mahatma Gandhi during 1939 to 1940 and they both tried

to get the Allied powers to their senses and prevent a war gandhi was a sincere friend of Hitler both of them were in

alignment on many issues they both were coming from a humanitarian position and recognized the evil force they were up

against gandhi knew that Hitler would be the last hope for peace in the

world dear friend we have no doubt about your bravery or devotion to your

fatherland nor do we believe that you are the monster described by your

opponents was a field with the British and P and operating the

to Adolf Hitler had never desired any war against the United Kingdom and continued sending out generous peace

offers awaiting a response from Britain the Germans remained passive there was

even a big peace movement in the summer of 1940 in Britain repeated peace rallies took place right outside

Churchill's windows in those days demonstrations could march down street up to number 10 and stand outside

Churchill's window and scream and say "We tired of your war we want peace." And it happened there were repeated

demonstrations outside his windows churchill realized that he needed a pretext to destroying Germany because

Hitler didn't want to initiate any bombing raids on London there was no other way that Churchill could drag the

Americans into the war unless he could provoke Hitler to do it churchill explained his intentions to Joe Kennedy

the American ambassador father of the late president i want the Germans to start bombing London as early as

possible because this will bring the Americans into the war and above all it will put an end to this awkward and

inconvenient peace movement that's a foot in my own cabinet and among the British

population it has been proven that it was Churchill not Hitler who initiated

the bombing of civilians according to the Gene of the Convention it was a major war crime to bomb civilians but

Churchill deliberately ordered the RAF to do it anyway the quiet period of the

phony war ended on 11th of May 1940 the day after Churchill became prime

minister as he immediately unleashed the aerial warfare on the German cities starting with Fryberg the British Royal

Air Force was ordered to bomb civilian areas the following day he launched his

first attacks on transport targets in the German industrial rural valley including Cologne during May Munchin

Gladbash Galing Kirishan Hamburg Bremen Essen Dbour Dusseldorf and Hanover were

attacked in June attacks were made on Dortmund Manhane Frankfurt and Bohung on

the 3rd of July 1940 British warships attacked French naval units in the North

African port city of Oruron to not fall into German hands churchill had clearly

indicated that he did not want peace churchill then ordered raids on Berlin which went on for the next seven

or 10 days hitler didn't respond not to that first raid not to the second not to the third or fourth getting angrier and

angrier though september the 4th Hitler made a famous speech at the sport palace

in Berlin biggest hall tens of thousands chosen audience he made a speech in

which he said this madman in London he's now trying to provoke us if we chose to we could if he drops 10 tons of bombs we

can go back and drop a hundred if he drops 100 tons of bombs on our towns and I can go back and drop a thousand tons

and I will one day i will one day if they come and destroy to say they they can destroy our cities he said "I

will rub out theirs outside i will rub out their cities." Very famous speech

which is what Church was waiting for very next day September the 5th he ordered a mass air raid on

Berlin finally on September the 6th broad daylight that afternoon the England the London population could hear

the the tread of the approaching German bombers coming up the temps and that afternoon September the 6th

1940 the beginning of the Blitz 6,000 Londoners were killed and and wounded in

injured in that area raid what Churchill wanted was the opposite of what Hitler had wanted now hit Churchill had tricked

him into the move that he never wanted to make as a result of Churchill's deliberate provocation a furious Hitler

finally retaliated and started bombing the docks in London the east end of London finally the city of London and

the West End on November 6th and 7th 1940 in September 1940 7,000 Londoners

were killed in the bombing on 16th of September 1940 on the orders of Winston

Churchill the British unleashed 100,000 of high explosive bombs and 14,000

firebombs in the first deliberate terror bombings of civilian districts of Manheim

deputy Furer Rudolph Hess was Hitler's right-hand man and longtime friend he

was Germany's second in command he was the guy who typed out the dictation for Hitler's mine comp in 1940 Hitler asked

Hess to get in touch with his English friends and tell them or any voter that

Germany only looked for peace he says "Private Rudolfph Hess you've got these

aristocratic friends of yours in England you're always talking about can't you contact them in some way?" and told them

that we want nothing from the British we just want peace we want an end to the war can't you get this message across to

the British people somewhere we got these contacts there but Hitler had said this to Rudolfph H you got these friends in Britain now you can surely contact

them and tell the British that we want nothing his offer for peace was the following hitler would be prepared to

withdraw the troops from France the Netherlands Belgium Poland and even Czechoslovakia

he also wanted Britain's agreement to have a free hand in the east to defeat communism he also wanted the former

German areas back in addition Hitler offered that the German Vermacht would

protect the British Empire if she ever was threatened by any enemy in May of

1941 Hes fly a solo mission with his measuresmith BF 110 over Scotland

at a time when Germany was winning the war he parachuted in carrying yet

another offer of peace to Britain hess was fluent in English and attempted to

meet up with what he believed to be British peace activists and to link up with the Duke of Hamilton who Hess had

befriended before at the 1936 Berlin Olympics he wanted to convince his British friend of Germany's sincere

desire for peace instead he fell into Churchill's hands and was arrested

winston Churchill of course refused to agree to Hitler's peace deal offered by Hess churchill instead imprisoned him

for life and ended his desperate peace mission churchill refused all peace

offers and kept them from the public hess was held in solitary confinement

for the duration of the war on Churchill's orders to hide who was the real wararmonger of the war

secret government documents revealed that the British received over two dozen offers of peace between 1939 and

1941 most notably in September 1939 October 1939 July 1940 after the fall of

France January 1941 etc the peace offers fell on deaf ears as Stersel would have

none of it he would instead continue doing his utmost to drag the US into the

war the wararmongers would find other means of continuing the war

be in 1933 in his first term President Franklin Roosevelt normalized relations

with the Communists and the Soviet Union was granted diplomatic recognition the Jewish William Christian Bullet was made

the first US ambassador to the government bullet was later reassigned as ambassador to France the 32nd degree

Freemason President Franklin Roosevelt suggested adding the allseeing eye and the pyramid to the dollar

[Music] bill roosevelt also openly praised

communism russia is far better off and the world is safer with Russia under

communism than under the SARS stalin is a great leader on the orders of the

Federal Reserve system and its private owners on 5th of April 1933 Franklin D

roosevelt issued presidential order 6102 which required all Americans to deliver

all [ __ ] coins gold billion and gold certificates to their local Federal Reserve Bank any violators would be

fined up to $10,000 imprisoned up to 10 years or both for knowingly violating this order

since then every US citizen is in depth from birth and is property of the privatelyowned Federal Reserve system

1933 and that was the year in November when Franklin Roosevelt then in his very

first term recognized the Soviet Union normalized

relations well this was already underway we already had the infiltration beginning Soviet directed a communist

party directed and what I discovered at a certain point in my research was that

in order to perpetuate this alliance to continue relations with the Soviet Union which became uh really an obsession of

American governments from that day forward the American government had to learn to lie to the people and tell us

lies about communism tell us lies about Stalin tell us lies about Soviet Union

malcolm Mugidge arrived in the USSR in 1932 he was one of the very few

journalists to report on the real conditions in the countryside for every article on the

famine that appeared two were published denying its existence mugidge recalls the most

influential correspondent in Moscow was Walter Duranti the Pulitzer Prizewinning

journalist for the New York Times [Music]

he was not only the greatest liar among the journalists in in Moscow but he was

the greatest love of any journalist that I've ever met in the 50 years of journalism

and we used to wonder whether in fact the authorities hadn't got some kind of hold over him because he so utterly

played their game

[Music]

when it came to the famine the great famine in the Ukraine that was when his reporting was particularly

disgraceful because he denied that there was any famine the Soviets actually

grant Duranti permission to tour Ukraine unshapered he reports in the Times that

all talk of famine now is ridiculous yet documents from the British Foreign

Office revealed that in private conversations at the British Embassy Duranti said as many as 10 million

people had [Music] died when they were discussing the

question of um recognizing the Soviet Union the United States government

recognizing the Soviet Union the articles of Duranti were considered as

very valuable evidence on the side of recognition

[Music]

and I think in some way this is where we see the rise of double standards i think

we also see the rise eventually of moral relativism cultural relativism these

ills that we we we see in our our culture today I think have their roots in this relationship and so I would

begin by but with this very beginning because I think it was that important november 16 1933 the day we recognized

the Soviet Union this was very strange given the

record of the Bolevik government coming in in terms of body count in that early

those early revolutionary years the Soviet the new Bolevik secret police

executed without trial more than 1,000 people per month later in the 1930s

Stalin was killing tens of thousands of people per month and yet the United

States rushed into alliance rushed to recognize the Soviet government under

Roosevelt during World War II rushed into this alliance

[Music] both the British and the American government were heavily infiltrated by

communist leading Jews and Soviet infiltrators the political leaders in both Britain and America were under the

controlling influence of a communist fifth column both Roosevelt and Churchill had surrounded themselves with

Jewish adviserss and relied on Jewish money to support their campaigns for office the Jews therefore had total

control of public opinion in both countries we later learned confirmed

after archives opened on the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991 we later

learned many of these senior officials in the United States government were working for Stalin they were Soviet

agents some of the communist Jews that had infiltrated the US government surrounding Roosevelt included Bernard

Baroo Phelix Frankfurter David Lilianthal David Niles Luis Brandai

Samuel Rosen Henry Morgan Tho Jr Benjamin Cohen Rabbi Steven Weiss Francis Perkins Sydney Hillman Herbert A

layman Jesse Strauss Harold Laski Charles Visansski Samuel Unterm Edward

Flynn David Dubinski Morai Squil Abby Forus Isidor Lubin Harry Dexter White

David Vinra Nathan Silvermaster Harold Glasser Irvin Kaplan Salman Adler

Benjamin Cardo Anna Rosenberg and numerous others these communistleaning

Jews basically function as the Soviet Union's agents within the American government as Jewish historian Lucy

Davididovich noted Roosevelt himself brought into his immediate circle more

Jews than any other president before or after him winston Churchill was not

better himself jerome the the mother of Churchill was

Jewish and uh this has been reported in in Jerusalem newspaper I think a few

months ago and now I'm obviously looking into that that she had um Jewish blood

in her maternal line very interesting indeed i don't think Churchill was cognizant of that fact he never

mentioned it but what is interesting are his links with the Jewish community which I'll go into in a little bit of

detail here the two basic areas of interest to to look at in Churchill's career at a period when he was in the

so-called wilderness when he resigned from Stanley Baldwin's cabinet as a minister and for the next 10 years until

1939 he was out of office out of any office at He was just a member of parliament so all he had was his salary

as a member of parliament and his rather pitiful earnings as a journalist and yet somehow he managed to support an

enormous country estate which cost a very large sum of money to support with all the gardeners and the nursery and

the ner the nurses and the nannies and the cooks and the housekeepers and all the rest of it he had a private staff of sometimes 20 or 30 people all supported

on his salary as a member of parliament which was at that time £500 perom £750 a

year or $2,000 actually because at that time I think it was $4 the pound how did he do it well the answer is that from

1936 onwards he was financed by a little secret pressure group called the focus you won't find me much reference

to the focus in the history books but it certainly existed and there are several files of Churchill's private papers relating to the focus the focus was a

group of perhaps 30 or 40 leading British industrialists and bankers and former politicians who decided that

Churchill was worth keeping afloat and they funded him they weren't all Jews

they were primarily Jewish but they were also left-wing socialists and left-wing conservative members of parliament who

all decided to keep him afloat in July 1936 the then chairman of the British uh

of the Shell Petroleum Company wrote out a check for Churchill of the order of £40,000 which in modern day money would

be probably about $700,000 and gave it to him as a gift he

was Jewish it was a Jewish gift to Churchill and the intention was that Churchill they they bought him he became

the pi piper from that moment on and the one who pays the piper calls the tune if

you look at the events as they really happened until 1936 he hardly gave Germany a passing mention in his

speeches and writings other things were more important from 1936 onwards he began beating the anti-Nazi anti-German

drum and at that time there was a great deal of pro-German sentiment in Britain as witnessed the behavior of the Duke of

Windsor the king Edward who King Edward VIII who ruled

for just less than a year after the death of his father was very pro-German and pro- Hitler and actually got on very

well with that alfitter when he visited Germany later in 1937 he was forced to abdicate by the

same lobby but it was this lobby which was financing Churchill from 1936 onwards and which finally maneuvered and

engineered his introduction into the cabinet in 1939 and finally his taking over as prime minister in 1940 he fought

a war that Britain had no real interest in i've repeatedly said this any logical

perception of World War II now looking back after 50 years screams to the high

heavens and we can see quite clearly that we should have said we should have said to the Poles in 1939 you've got a

problem with the Germans sort it out yourself we should have said to the to the Jews you've got a problem with the

Nazis sort it out yourself it's no concern of Britain and the British Empire we've got other fish to fry

that's what we should have said churchill unfortunately was beholden to these people and he had no alternative

so in 1940 when we had a choice put to us of accepting the very generous peace

offer that was put to us which has been concealed from the history books by the Germans or of fighting a totally

senseless war onwards churchill took the wrong turning and bankrupted Britain and ruined the British Empire i first said

this in my book Churchill's war in 1987 and now five other major historians have said the same thing this has now become

known as the revisionist line of history on of Second World War and I'm the one who actually opened up that path making

people think the unthinkable looking at the alternative routes that we could have taken in 1940 in 1941 just to end this it becomes

very interesting indeed because the Vitzman papers which are the papers of

Kim Vitzman who was the first president of the state of Israel and he was the leader of the international Zionist

movement throughout World War II the Vitzman archives foolishly or wisely

gave me complete access to all the Vitesman correspondence with Churchill and in the Vitesman archives all

Churchill's correspondence with Vitzman throughout the war years and before the war and all his notes on his meetings

with Churchill and I'm only going to mention one of those letters here is a letter written by Kim Vitzman the leader

of the Zionist movement at that time living in the United States to Winston Churchill in September

1941 three months before Pearl Harbor when Churchill is frantically trying to

claw the United States into his war because that's his only salvation and vitam writes to Churchill a letter which

he says "Mr prime Minister unless you grant us what we want which is the

creation of a Jewish army in the Middle East with our own arsenal and our own weapons and our own uniform and our own

flag unless you grant us what what we want then you are not going to win us over and let me tell you what we will do

if you do grant us what we want if you grant us our wishes then we will act on

your behalf in the United States and remember Mr churchill he writes in his letter "Remember we are the only

powerful unified block in the United States which solidly backs the British cause in this war." September 1941

everybody else is basically isolationist we are the only ethnic unified group

which solidly backs the British cause we are the only people who are in the position to bring the United States into
