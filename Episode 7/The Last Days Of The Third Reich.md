as the communists moved west they carried out brutal massacres on a regular basis in Bellarus Estonia Latvia

Lithuania Poland Ukraine and Russia Thousands of innocent intellectuals and

thought criminals were slaughtered already When the communists claimed eastern territory of Poland thousands of

Polish soldiers were brutally captured by the Red Army Stalin then ordered

15,000 Polish officers imprisoned in special camps at Koshielskov and Sarroilsk partially

because he feared that these men might had a potential of starting a national movement capable of resisting the

communist takeover of Poland in the future On the 5th of March 1940 Stalin

and Kaganovich signed an order to execute Polish army and police officers

The Jewish secret police chief Laventthia Beria was an infamous butcher

who committed his crimes by blaming them on the national socialists He sent 20

million people to slave labor camps Bera then masterminded what would be called

the Kadin Forest Massacre In April 1940 Stalin ordered more than 10,000 Polish

officers taken into the Kading Forest near Gnistova village a short distance from Smolansk Russia where the victims

were executed The Poles were marched into the forest wearing their uniforms with their hands tied behind their backs

and within shot in the back of their necks Thousands were buried in huge mass graves Many of these victims couldn't

later be recognized by their relatives due to the fact that their bodies and faces had been brutally demolished by

the Red Army Some Poles were executed in Khalen and Carco prison and elsewhere Of

the total killed about 8,000 were officers in prison during the 1939 Soviet invasion of Poland Another 6,000

were Polish officers and the rest were arrested Polish intelligencia that the Soviets deemed to be intelligence agents

landowners saboturs factory owners lawyers officials and priests An

estimate of about 22,000 of the best Poles were killed by the NKVD in this

massacre alone

When the Germans discovered the mass graves in early 1943 they brought in a European Red Cross committee called the

Kading Commission comprising 12 forensic experts and their staff But at the Nuremberg trials the Soviets just blamed

the Germans for perpetrating the Kading Massacre and the British French and Americans just let them do it Numerous

German officers were wrongly hung for the murder of thousands of innocent Polish nationalists Murders that in fact

were committed by Stalins and KVD President Roosevelt purposely and deliberately covered up the evidence of

who really committed these crimes that such corruption could have been going on in high levels of the US government

during those years proves that we should question official evidence of the Holocaust and World War II The Soviet

report which blamed the Germans for committing the Caden massacre was listed at Nuremberg as 054 USSR Member of the

special state commission academic NN Berdenko a member of the special state

commission Mithropolitus Nikolai two obvious liars with an agenda signed this

report These were the same known liars who also signed the official Soviet report on Oshwitz that was listed at

Nuremberg as 008 USSR This alone should be cause for

concern to anyone carrying the slightest bit about objective truth The Soviet

report on Ashwitz was signed by two proven liars The Soviets kept their own

crimes a secret Not until 1989 were communist documents released documenting

the fact that the Soviet NKVD carried out the Kading massacre In 2012 World

Press reported their recent findings on the Kading Massacre As it long was suspected Churchill and Roosevelt knew

that Stalin had ordered the massacre but kept their mouth shut about it The US

covered it

up On 17th of November 1941 Stalin issued Order

0428 stating that communist partisans would dress up in German uniforms

particularly those of the Vafen SS and destroy all settlements within a swath of about 40 to 60 kilometer depth from

the main battle lines and to ruthlessly kill the civilian population It was

important to leave a few survivors with these attacks who would report the supposed German

atrocities This method of warfare was also confirmed by German soldiers who captured many Russian partisans wearing

German uniforms

The Bolsheviks were purposely sacrificing their own people in this ways to create anti-German propaganda

and to instill hatred for the Germans and the Soviet troops In order to drive the message home entirely they also had

photographed these horrors The famous photos are now the favorites in the press used as proof of the alleged

systematic mass murder of Jews The order stipulated "It is important to have

survivors who will tell about German atrocities For this purpose every regiment is to form hunter units of

about 20 to 30 men strong with the task to detonate and incinerate the villages

when working in German uniforms behind enemy lines in destroying those settlement outposts

among the population We have to spread the rumor that the Germans are burning the villages in order to punish the

partisans With their free arsenal supplemented by America's finest tanks Tommy guns planes trucks jeeps and even

food and blankets the Red Army advanced on Germany from the east Stalin's plot

to take all of Eastern Europe was helped by Eisenhower and Marshall's obsession with invading Europe from England

instead of simply advancing from Europe's soft underbelly By July 1944

the communists had rolled into Poland and advancing to Germany Stalin's Jewish chief propagandist and prominent member

of the Soviet sponsored Jewish anti-fascist committee Ilia Erinberg

instigated the Soviet Red Army rape and murder of German civilians Referring to German women Arenberg gloated to the

advancing Red Army troops That blonde hag is in for a bad time Just like the

Jews around Roosevelt Arenberg also sought the extermination and genocide of

the entire German people Ilia Arinberg encouraged the mass rape and killing of German women Ilia's leaflets declared

"The Germans are not human beings Nothing gives us so much joy as German

corpses." As the soldiers approached Dansik millions of leaflets were aird dropped on the troops with a message

composed by the propagandist Arenburgg and signed by Stalin Kill them all

men old men children and women after you have amused yourself with them Kill

Nothing in Germany is guiltless Neither the living nor the yet unborn Break the racial pride of the

German woman Take her as your legitimate booty Kill your brave soldiers of the

victorious Soviet army An unimaginable orgy of violence and

rape emerged which would mark one of the ghastliest episodes in human history At least 2 million German women young and

old were gang raped sodomized and beaten often in view of their children or

family members Parties of soldiers raided houses in wild orgies of drunken

violence Women were penetrated with broken bottles or bayonets It was all the same whether the communist raped

mere children or old women The women were raped not once or twice but 10 20

30 and 100 times Mothers were raped in the presence of their children Girls

were raped in front of their brothers Even terrified women who fled to churches and hospitals were hunted down

raped and tortured to death Nuns little girls and elderly women were infected

with veneerial diseases There were cases of breast being cut off and victims set on fire after being

raped Some German women were forced at gunpoint to make out with dead rotting

corpses Pregnant women had their babies cut out of their bodies Some babies had their heads bashed in A naked woman was

nailed through the hands in a crucified posture A woman 84 years old was found

sitting on a sofa half of whose head had been sheared off with an axe or a spade

Women including children and old men were all murdered in a beastial manner

As the final pockets of German resistance in the east surrendered one girl remembered rape began almost

immediately and there was a viciousness in the acts

Hey it's more than just rape It's the spiritual massacre the deliberate

destruction of German womanhood by rape And your husband sees this thing

He's warned "If you do anything we'll cut you in half." You see this saw we've got here we will literally cut you in

half [Music]

[Music]

The most notable offenders were the almost completely Jewish NKVD rear guard

troops and the Mongoloy troops from the Asian republics of the far eastern reaches of the USSR To these troops the

German woman represented everything that they hated about white Europeans Thus her pride was to be crushed Many of the

ethnic Russians in the army also regarded these Jewish-led troops as utterly merciless By and large the

commasaars in the Russian army were Jewish Now there was a a lot of commasars but these are the political

officers that are in every unit above I suppose above a platoon that are there

to make sure that everyone toes the party line Everyone's a good communist Everyone's a a good German hater In

other words you've got these people these Jewish commissars badgering the soldiers to kill more to kill more kill

more rape more And basically they're the cheerleaders that go along with every unit uh roughly the size of a company I

would say And so you've got these unsophisticated soldier boys youthful you've got the Jewish commaars who are

encouraging them to do their dead level best And so when someone like Ilia Arenburgg on the right hand of Joseph

Stalin says it is not only okay but it's almost a command for you to take the

German women play with them rape them as often as you want and then kill them That sounds like an order that's

sanctified That's sanctioned by the Soviet government

It is estimated that as many as 2 million German women were raped by Red Army soldiers

One prisoner was a 14-year-old boy The guards poured gasoline on his curly

black hair and set it on fire The boy went insane

The men they were beaten with a toleger a beater to death It's a long steel

spring and at the end is a big lead ball and you use it like a raetball racket

Your arm your wrist and your wrist and the spring they deliver a triple hit to

a German's face One of Lola's guards told me "Yeah the Germans in Lola's

prison were worse off than Lola." Lola wasn't locked up in a room night and day

She wasn't tortured night after night She herself had told me "Thank God

nobody tried to rape us The Germans weren't allowed to." But all of that happened to German girls at Lola's

Presets Now the office of state security was a Polish government organization The

leaders were Polish Jews The chief of the off of the office in Warsaw was a

Jew The department directors or all or almost all of them were Jews In the

province where Lola was Cisia in Sisia the director of the office of state

security was a Jew I met him in Copenhagen Little bald-headed man The director of prisons was a Jew The

secretary of state security was a Jew And in Cisia in 1945 three4s of the

officers three4s were Jews I interviewed 24 And I learned that the office of

state security ran 227 prisons for German civilians

This one camp I found the death certificates for 1,583

Germans In other camps other prisons thousands of German civilians died

German men women children babies At one camp there was a barrack

for 50 babies They were in cribs But the camp doctor he was a Jew Dr

Sarovski he didn't heat the barracks He didn't give the babies milk and 48 of

the 50 babies died All in all 60,000 to 80,000 Germans

died in the custody of the office office of state security Jewish reporters who knew about

it didn't write about it There's a working reporter right now in New York City He was in Poland right after World

War II He tells me "Whatever the Germans tell you believe me it's true." But he

himself never wrote about it The truth was covered up and was still being covered up

In February 1945 Stalin travel to the Black Sea result of Yaltta to attend the

most historic of the big three conferences of the war At the Yaltta conference the plot to reshaping of the

post-war world was made The biggest winner was Stalin Churchill muttered to Stalin "We have killed six or seven

million Germans and probably there will be another million or so killed before the end of the war." Communist spies

Algaris and Harry Hopkins heavily influenced Roosevelt and it was decided that after Germany's defeat the Soviets

would occupy Eastern Europe The Soviets would eventually join the war against Japan and be supplied with US arms for

the effort After Japan was defeated the Soviets would occupy northern Korea

without Korea's approval and Manuria and China without China's approval Millions

of Russian PWs captured by the Germans as well as Russian refugees fleeing

Stalin would be forcefully returned to Stalin to be executed or worked to death

Germany would be split in half as would the capital of Berlin The formation of a

communist new world order United Nations would be made after the

[Music] war On 28th of April 1945 when total

defeat was imminent for Europe Mussolini attempted to escape to neutral Switzerland but Italian communist

partisans captured Mussolini and his lover Clara Pitachi along with several of their friends After a sweeping trial

they were both executed near Lake Kumo in northern Italy Mussolini was undressed tortured and violated and Clar

Patachi was raped several times prior to being killed Not only was Claretta gang

raped by the communist but all of the women in the fleeing group with Mussolini suffered the same fate At the

end of the hell she was murdered beside the man she loved These human monsters

sodomized Mussolini's corpse They urinated on it and kicked and beat his body until it was barely recognizable as

human The bodies were then thrown into a heap in the suburban square in the city of Milan At least one British secret

service member and numerous communists whipped a crowd into a frenzy They attacked the corpses in all ways

possible Eventually the bodies were lifted up and hung upside down on meat

hooks An American eyewitness described the crowd as sinister depraved and out

of control [Music]

There was nothing to stop the Allies from taking the German capital before the advancing Soviet army could get

there Roosevelt's lap dog Eisenhower however would yet again find a way to

delay the Allied advance so as to buy time for Stalin to advance into Berlin

from the east On March 28 Eisenhower even sent a message to Stalin assuring

him that the Allied advance would focus on Western Germany primarily to give

Berlin to Stalin On April 15 Eisenhower even went so far as issuing a halt order

forbidding Allied commanders from crossing the Alb River The generals

Montgomery and Patton were extremely upset over this order to halt the

advance Eisenhower's orders left Berlin and all of Eastern Europe to Soviet

communism Hitler had heard about Mussolini's death whilst in his bunker in Berlin By his

side was the ever faithful Eva Brown Surrounded by his high command they had been there since 16th of January 1945

Churchill's bombings of German civilians and the rape of Germany went on nonstop

By spring of 1945 the situation had become all but hopeless for the Germans

The Red Army had reached a river odor which was the last great national obstacle before Berlin Germany would now

be surrounded from every frontier The Soviets had twice as many men as the Vermont and four times as many tanks

Stalin claimed that he had 6 million men against the remaining 1 million Germans of every unit the Reich could find

Hitler knew that he was surrounded

Facing a certain defeat foreign volunteers old men women and children prepared for the last fight against

hopeless odds Boys of the Hitler use also prepared themselves for the last battle The only thing that stood between

heaven and hell was the remaining German troops On the 19th of April Soviet troops reached the Berlin suburbs Every

remaining desperate defender of Germany would be eliminated in houseby street

fighting The Red Terror couldn't be haunted anymore The combat embraced everyone in its battle zone Hitler's

dreams of a free world had been shattered to a million pieces

Although Hitler had his guardian angel fighter pilot Hannah Raich Hana was so

utterly devoted to Hitler that she received an iron cross in the Second World War Raich was also the first woman

to fly a helicopter a rocket plane and a Yet Fighter And on the 29th of April she

flew her light aircraft into the chaotic heart of Berlin to make a daring rescue attempt offering an exit to Hitler if he

wished to escape from the besieged city Hanarish was Hitler's last chance

to escape Hitler told Hana "You're a very brave woman There is still loyalty

and courage in the world." But he had already chosen to meet his destiny in Berlin He would stay

[Music] Eva Brown and Adolf Hitler had met when

she was just 17 and she worked as an assistant to the photographer Hindridge Hoffman who went on to become Hitler's

personal cameraman Hitler and Brown became lovers in 1932 Now 13 years later as the

remaining German forces were overwhelmed Eva wrote in a letter to her friend Hart Schneider we are fighting here until the

last but I'm afraid the end is threatening closer and

closer On April 29th Hitler decided to marry his longtime mistress Eva Brown

The ceremony was concluded with Goubles and Borman as witnesses Hitler signed the wedding certificate but when it was

Eva's turn she began to write her surname as Brown before crossing out the letter B and instead writing Eva Hitler

Arm in-armm Hitler led his bride to the study for the wedding reception Hitler

now admitted for the first time that all was lost Hitler said "Everything is lost Pack your things and go You have to

leave and within an hour the last plane would bring you out." After that moment of silence Eva Brown stepped forward

went to him and took his hand and said "But you know I will stay with you." Less than 2 days after the wedding

on April 30th Hitler and his bride ended their lives together They had been married just a few hours Eva took a sin

capsule popped it into her mouth She died instantly Hitler picked up his gun put it to his right temple and fired

Hitler's dog Blondie was also poisoned Members of the staff carried the bodies in blankets and soaked them with what

petrol they could find and set them al light Hitler did not want to be handed over to the barbaric boleviks because he

knew what they had done to Mussolini Thus taking his life and setting his body on fire was his own

wish One day before committing suicide Hitler dictated his political testament

a suicide note in which he denied any responsibility for starting the war

On the 5th of June 1945 the Allies announced that they would govern Germany

from four different occupation zones one for each of the four powers Soviet

Britain France United States Churchill had declared war to supposedly defend

Poland but instead allied himself with Stalin covered up his crimes and then

gave Poland to him Albert Einstein is today reverred as

the greatest genius of the 20th century Einstein was a Jewish physicist and a

member of the German Communist Party a scientist and a supporter of the Bolevik

slaughtering regime in Soviet Union He is credited with creating Einstein's

special and general theory of relativity His writings have been accused of plagiarism by many historians and

researchers One of the most famous mathematical equations in the world E=

MC² was first published by Oto de Pto 2 years prior to Einstein's publishing of

the equation The equation E= MC² should rightfully be called the PTO

equation He was a commie He says he was a pacifist but he wanted war with Germany He actually wanted to genocide

Germans There was a quote where he said "The Germans can be killed or constrained after the war but they

cannot be re-educated to a democratic way of thinking and acting It is hoped that by war's end they will largely have

been killed off." Albert Einstein said this at Lincoln University California Einstein gave a speech in which he

called racism a disease of white people and added "I do not intend to be quiet about it but he was vehematly anti-ist

and anti-white but very very pro-Jewish In fact he was offered a presidency of

Israel He politely declined the offer by saying "I'm deeply moved by the offer from our state of Israel and at once

saddened and ashamed that I cannot accept." He was a hardcore Zionist but opposed nationalism at every turn for

Europeans In fact he wanted to crush it So what did he give us anyway everything

is relative Relative moral relativism Nothing is certain No such thing as an absolute Anything goes What is truth

anyway there's no meaning except relativism of course right so only his view of the universe is the right one

that we're all choking to death on Right many physicists disagree with his theories because that's all they are is

theories Well how is he how has he even gotten this big in the first place well

it's a fact that his work was not only twisted unscientific ideas but that it

was science that was plagiarized I know Red Eyes did a show on this a great show on this covering this in detail His

writings included his popular 1924 book meaning of relativity which was plagiarized from the Lawrence

transformation plagiarism of the mass energy equivalence largely based on the work of George Fitzgerald and Hrik

Lawrence Irish and Dutch theoretical physicists and also the work of French physicist Henry help me with this

poair Poner there you go he developed Poner there you go he developed a theory

of relativity years before Einstein Einstein and it gets worse plagiarism of Paul Gerber or is it Gerber's

groundbreaking work on the speed of gravity Okay this was a German guy and the idea that the speed of light was a

constant and was independent of the motion of its source was not Einstein's at all but was proposed by the Scottish

scientist James Maxwell in 1878 Also Burhard Ryman a German was the

first to develop a sound non uklidian geometry which is the basis of all the math he used to describe relativity Also

it goes on Heinrich Hertz the the father of the unit of frequency hertz right

sound vibration discovered that electrol illuminated with ultraviolet light and

they create electric sparks more easily well in 1905 Einstein published the paper explaining this same experiment

from Herz's photoelectric effect and it was actually Herz's discovery that led to the quantum revolution yet Einstein

was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1921 for the discovery of the law of the

photoelectric effect Okay it goes on Nicola Tesla he could not stand Einstein

In fact he called him an old crank He gave a scathing analysis of Einstein's relativity theory calling it a

magnificent mathematical garb which fascinates dazzles and makes people blind to the underlying errors The

theory is like a beggar cloth in purple whom ignorant people take for a king He said this in 1935

uh John Murray Kudahee a brilliant known sociologist said Einstein was motivated

by a desire to distort and destroy western science very very accurate

Clarence Miller president of Britain's Royal Astronomical society disagreed with all Einstein's theory he had his

own absolute space theory which is interesting and it goes on a hundred prestigious Austrian and German

scientists denounced him in this book uh Hundert I don't I don't know how to say it Altern I'll pull it up right here Um

accused him of being a pseudomsticism and pseudomstic and a and

just speculating everything Basically a hundred scientists HL Manin there's sound reason for believing that Einstein

will not hold up in the long run His curve space may be clased with psychossemantic bumps of Gaul and

Spursheim two other brilliant scientists So the point is we wouldn't be in the stone age without him Hardly we'd be

cultivating other planets by now right and then people who say "Oh you're just jealous of him." Or "Oh it's because

he's Jewish." No it's because he was a thief a liar and a plagiarist and an awful person in his private life And you

know true brilliant people couldn't stand him and they viewed him as a crackpot crackpot and a liar and a

plagiarist because he was and Einstein criticized scientists He felt threatened by true geniuses like Irwin Schrodener

quantum theory Wernern Heisenberg Hilbert Plank He was actually the

jealous one who was attacking all these But he he was propped up as the archetype of brilliance genius and

science the smartest men alive and he was a Jew right so he's just a pure

creation basically of a Jewish media hype that was manufactured in the 20s basically like a pop star But he was a

commie who failed his college entrance exam and shamelessly ripped off true geniuses So he's all smok and mirrors

He's a fraud people And I don't know if you guys have heard this before but it it's massive Germany Henrik as you said

was thriving I mean just amazing minds were coming out of Germany in this time

It's not like Einstein took Germany out of some kind of stone age and they were you know they were not going to advance

without his brilliance right while Europe was still at peace in 1939 the

development of the American atomic bomb was proposed by Albert Einstein Eugene

Vner and Leard all Jews to Roosevelt

They wrote a letter to him in which they described the power of a potential atomic bomb Einstein falsely insinuated

that Germany was already working on an atomic bomb and urges Grosselt into

building such a weapon Out of this effort emerged the Manhattan project in

which the development of the atomic bomb was done The leader was Robert Oppenheimer Developers were Rickard

Feman Owen Chamberlain Enrio Fernie Edward Teller John Noman and others On

the afternoon of April 12th 1945 Roseell died in a massive stroke The failed

businessman and KKK member Vice President Harry Truman now became

president Roosevelt's Jewish and communist inner circle continued to run the show while Truman from Misery

delivered the

speeches In April and May 1945 Japan made three attempts through

neutral Sweden and Portugal to bring a peaceful end to the war In August Japan

tried via neutral Soviet channels to negotiate surrender Every peace attempt

made by Japan would also be fruitless Ignoring the Japanese pleads

for peace the Allies would instead prepare for major attacks on Japan The

United States Air Force had carried out bombing raids against around 60 Japanese

cities such as Tokyo already in 1942 Now on the night of 9th to 10th of March

1945 2,000 tons of the exact same type of incendiary bombs dropped on Dresston

one month earlier was employed in the genocidal terror bombing on Tokyo The

order came from Air Force General Curtis Lame to fly as low as possible and to

bomb the Japanese homes and other buildings which were made of wood or paper to cause as much havoc as possible

Thousands of civilians were burned or asphixxiated to death The burnt bodies

of 100,000 dead civilians covered the streets Millions of innocent Japs were

injured and left homeless The bombings would be repeated

on May 23rd and 25th American Air Force General Curtis Lameé

boasted that the American bombers were driving the Japanese back to the Stone

Age This however would later be overshadowed by the following atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and

Nagasaki

[Music]

These bombings resulted in the immediate deaths of around 100 to 150,000 in

Roshima and 60 to 80,000 in Nagazaki from injuries sustained from the

explosions and acute radiation sickness and even more deaths from long-term effects of ionizing

radiation Between the two bombings Stalling broke the Soviet Japanese non-aggression pact of 1941 and declared

war upon an already beaten Japan Soviet troops even began pouring into Manuria

overwhelming the Japanese forces there Japan surrendered on 15th of August 1945

General Patton warned about letting Stalin get to Berlin before the Americans After a visit to ruin Berlin

he wrote to his wife on July 21st 1945 Berlin gave me the blues We have

destroyed what could have been a good race and we are about to replace them with Mongolian savages and all Europe

will be communists It is said that for the first week after they took Berlin all women who ran were shot and those

who did not were raped I could have taken it instead of the Soviets had I been

allowed As the war now had ended the Jewish genocidal Morgan thou plan was

implemented for the total destruction of German industry and the enslavement of the German race The winners would now

basically starve millions of Germans mostly civilians to death to inflict collective punishment on the German

people Germany's real nightmare was about to unfold as the communist imposed a collective punishment upon Germany

that will make the Versail treaty shrink in comparison In the greatest act of ethnic cleansing the world has ever seen

the Allied powers imposed a new reign of terror destruction looting starvation

rape and mass killing of the German people The occupying Allied armies carved off 25% of Germany's most fertile

land The German refugees were then attacked and raped by the Red Army as well as Jewish partisan gangs who ceased

and occupied the stolen homes of the German refugees Churchill supported the expulsion of 15 million occupied German

civilians from territories they inhabited More than 3 million Germans died during the forest migrations about

2 million civilians mostly women children and elderly and 1 million prisoners of war In between 1939 and

1945 around 7 million German PS were loaded onto cattle cars and transported

to the Soviet gulags The majority of them would never see their families again Stalin issued order 270 which

meant that all Russian prisoners captured by the Germans would now be sent to death camps and later executed

Even their wives would be sent to the gulags German civilians and anti-communist allies everywhere were

rounded up raped sodomized drowned in cesspools tortured genily mutilated

burned alive and executed Rows of bodies were hanged in the trees Cruel

punishment was meed out against hundreds of thousands of those labeled as Nazi collaborators whose only crime was in

making peace with Germany or to have fought against the Soviets on the Eastern Front as members of the German

SS units

French women who dated German soldiers during the occupation were humiliated by having their head shaven bald or

stripped naked

Anti-communist refugee families who had followed their German defenders as they retreated from the east were shipped

back to Stalin as well where they were subjected to torture including rape of the women Stalin also held 25,000

American PS and 30,000 British in his Siberian gulags and even rapidly started

executing many of them Stalin never released the rest of them and they perished in the gulags

As part of the psychological reprogramming and warfare known as d-nazification the German people were

deliberately subjected to anti-German propaganda hunger psychological trauma and homelessness Starving German women

sold their bodies to American soldiers in exchange for food soap or secrets The

Allies worked fanatically to fulfill their genocidal pact with Stalin "We ought to get rid of them all as soon as

possible," wrote an impatient Winston Churchill Don't mind the five or four million Germans Stalin will see to them

You will not have trouble with them They will cease to exist In his diary George

Patton noted "Today we received orders in which we were told to give the Jews special accommodations If we're Jews why

not Catholics Mormons etc We are also turning over to the French several hundreds thousands prisoners of war to

be used as slave labor in France It is amusing to recall that we fought the revolution in defense of the rights of

man and the civil war to abolish slavery and have now gone back on both principles He wrote to his wife on the

23rd of July 1945 If what we are doing to the Germans is liberty then give me

death I can see how Americans can sink so low It is Semitic and I'm sure of it

Within the first hour of the first liberation of the Dao prisoners of war camp 122 SS guards were shot after

surrendering to the US 45th division Another 40 SS men were beaten to death

by the inmates Another 358 SS men were rounded up and herded into an enclosed

coal yard Initially 12 were machine gunned The rest were executed shortly thereafter Totally 560 men who had

surrendered were murdered during the liberation of Dhao This was a brutal war crime Still the US soldiers went

unpunished A US soldier said the men were deliberately wounded guards A lot

of guards were shot in the leg so they couldn't move They were then turned over to the inmates One was beheaded with a

bayonet Others were ripped apart limp by limp In May of 1945 Churchill betrayed

tens of thousands of Karats that had surrendered to them Instead he returned

them to Soviet and Yugoslav communists resulting in the Bllyberg massacre General George Patton was

disgusted by the genocidal policies against the German people Patton knew that the policies for the genocide and

destruction of the German people originated from the Jews in Washington DC surrounding Morgan thou and Roosevelt

In a letter to his wife Patton wrote "Evidently the virus started by Morgan

thou of a symitic revenge against all Germans is still working

Even before the war had ended thousands of German prisoners of war had died in

American captivity from starvation mistreatment and outright murder A

survivor from one of the camps in April 1945 wrote "Each group of 10 was given

the outdoor space of medium-sized living room We had to live like this for 3 months No roof over our heads Even the

badly wounded only got a bundle of straw And it rained on the Rine for days And

we were always in the open People died like flies The Allied commander

Eisenhower was in control of over 5 million living enemy soldiers It is a

pity we could not killed more muttered the general dissatisfied with the body count of the greatest slaughter in human

history God I hate the Germans Eisenhower had written his wife in 1944

Because the Geneva Convention guaranteed prisoners of war of Sina nations the same food shelter and medical attentions

as their captures And because these laws were to be enforced by the International Red Cross Eisenhower basically just

dodged the treaty by creating his own category for the prisoners He suggested

a new class of prisoner disarmed enemy forces dees prisoners the army would not

feed Get that they would not feed after Germany's surrender Altogether the

Allies had between seven and 8 million German prisoners They captured 4.2

million before the new DEF status similar to another type surrendered

enemy persons SEFs Author Giles Macdonald

writes that the latter captives about 3 to four million and I quote were not entitled to the same levels of shelter

and subsistence unquote The Soviets had not signed any agreements regarding

humanitarian treatment of prisoners of war Therefore they were not obligated to treat their prisoners humanely The

allies intended to use the Germans as slave labor Also according to the Morgan

thou plan to cover up his crimes Eisenhower issued an order asserting

that the Red Cross officials were not allowed access to his death camps

I think Jim Bach has made a major historical find here To me as an American historian I'm ashamed There was

sadism brutality denial of medical supplies that were available denial of water in some cases when they were right

on the banks of the Rinemen died of dehydration From my own experience I saw that the wounded were left unattended No

one cared We were treated just like cattle There was no camp just the rine meadows which later turned into a swampy

morass There were no tents or shelter of any kind and they had robbed us of everything We were all freezing

shivering with cold lying squatting We tried to find a dry spot and lay there in the open Of course I was a guard at

the US Army prison camp and I was warned not to speak about what I experienced or I'd be in trouble Well the conditions in

in the camp were abominable We uh neglected to feed them properly They got

a can of watery soup once a day and it was so inadequate they were throwing grass and weeds into it when they could

find them They were starving and we did not have enough water for them even We were near the Ryan River so they would

crawl under the wires in an effort to get some water and we'd machine gun them

when they did that Had no blankets no tents Some of them had no overcoats and

they were sleeping in the mud This was April towards the end of the war and uh it was a cold uh late spring and so it

was they were dying and dying in great numbers What impressed us all of us of course were the trucks hauling the

bodies away So when we were shoved off the box cars we were driven into the meadows in a big pack and at the very

beginning we were told over the loudspeaker you are not regular prisoners of war You are disarmed

enemies and therefore do not fall under the Geneva Convention And we were also told to make things perfectly clear on

Eisenhower's order in English and in German that they had not come to free us from national socialism but to eliminate

Germany once and for all After 2 and 1/2 years I weighed 30 kilograms I had lost my

homeland I had lost most of my relatives and I was all by myself in East

Germany and I just wanted to get home but we never got home

Millions more Germans died of Allied action after the war than during the war

Certainly 9 million more dead Germans in the six years of peace only because of

Allied policy The Allied governments covered up this tremendous national

slaughter and are still doing so the subject is a forbidden subject and

in the United States it's a subject we don't want to investigate So for these reasons the uh the subject uh has has

been covered up to an extent just denial of it not looking at it not researching

destroying records

Immediately after World War II the Jewish poet Abba Kovner founded the

organization called Nakam consisting of a group of Jewish partisans Abba Covener had spent his

latest years illegally smuggling Jews to Palestine Even though the war was over

for everyone else this group was so unsatisfied with the death tolls of Germans they started hunting down

Europeans and killing them randomly They put on the trucks the Uen the Jews are

coming to frighten the population

Governor for [Music]

[Music] One of their objectives was the deaths of 6 million Europeans through poisoning

their water supplies [Music]

This plan was called plan A Plan B was to poison a few thousand loaves of bread

at the bakery that supplied four prisons and concentration camps including Dhaka

where the Germans now were interned by the Allies

As a first step Kar was sent to Tel Aviv to win the support of the Jewish leaders

in the pre-state Israel for the plan to poison Germans Israeli president and

chemist Wiseman was receptive and approved of the plan Heim recommended a

scientist who would make poison for them The scientist worked at the Seif Institute in Rihavot later renamed the

Viceman Institute Returning to Europe on a British ship Covener was arrested by

the British police who apparently was familiar with the plot At that time Coer carried enough poison to murder the

inhabitants of four major European cities through their water supplies but

he was instead sent to an Egyptian jail Plan A had failed

The rest of the organization regrouped back in Germany and the Lithuanianborn Jew Joseph Harmatz took over the Nakam

leadership He abandoned the idea of poisoning the water supplies of the Germans Instead the group acquired a

small quantity of arsenic and reverted to the more modest bread poisoning plan

And then we decided that we're ready to do it One Saturday night in April

1945 they broke into the Stalog 13 camp at Nuremberg And with an artist brush

Hermits painted 3,000 loaves of black bread with poison

[Music]

They smeared 3,000 breads which was enough for 12,000

About 2,280 SS men ate the bread he said but

could not say how many or if any died News reports at the time said more than

200 people were hospitalized but made no mention of deaths

American army has mobilized all the ambulances And they had thousands and they were

carrying them to all the possible hospitals and were pumping him pumping

out Harmmets lived out the remainder of his life respected and honored by his fellow Jews The genocidal terrorist

Cover was quietly released into Jewish Israeli hands after only a year in

custody The next year the Jewish terrorist group disguised themselves as

Arabs and bombed the King David hotel in Jerusalem killing 91 people Manimbin was

the leader of this terrorist group In the future he would be known as the prime minister of Israel despite his

racist and supremacist views and his terrorist background
