a man who resented this degeneration of Germany possibly more than anyone else in the world was out of Hitler Born on

April 20th 1889 into a workingclass family he was raised learning everything

in life the hard way Hitler lived as a homeless drifter for

most of his life in the city of Vienna after being rejected by the art

college While he apparently wasn't good enough to earn a position at the academy he quickly discovered that many Jewish

artists were Some of these Jewish artists also migrated to Berlin producing pornography and erotica for a

living

Hitler volunteered to fight for Austria in 1914 By that time both of his parents

had passed away He then begged Bavarian authorities to let him fight for Germany

He fought with great bravery instinct and distinction and was promoted to lance corporal He received the Military

Cross Iron Cross Second Class Iron Cross first class and six medals for bravery

He was wounded twice in October of 1916 He was badly wounded and abided two

months in a military hospital He could have stayed home but instead chose to return to the front

lines In October 1918 he was temporarily blinded by a British poison gas attack

Hitler heard about the capital of Germany while recovering his eyesight at the hospital He was confused and

outraged after hearing the news and thought that the sacrifice and suffering of the German soldiers had been for

nothing The artist from Vienna wanted answers and he would not rest until the

enemies had been exposed and Germany's honor restored again When Adolf Hitler

joined the German Workers Party DAP in 1919 he became the seventh member of the

Nationalist Group Hitler then decided that the time was

right to seize power of the local government in [Music] Munich Patriotic war veterans would join

him in the revolt and move against the national government in Berlin Hitler then used a rally in

Munich beer hall to launch a coup An enthusiastic crowd turned out to support

him The local uprising or pooch was ignited by a moving speech by Hitler but

it was interfered by communist troops who opened fire on the nationalists killing 16 of them Hitler and the others

were arrested and tried for treason At his trial Hitler used his opportunity to

spread his political and philosophical ideas which apparently were so inspiring that they afterwards even published them

in some newspapers The judge was incredibly impressed and issued a lenient sentence for Hitler and the

nationalist rebels The Munich coupe failed but the legend of the great speaker grew and by every day that went

by he fascinated and attracted new followers He quickly generated a large

support base During his imprisonment of 1924 he wrote the Bible of National

Socialism Minecomf my struggle His close associate Rudolph Hess imprisoned with

Hitler typed out the dictation for the book which was published in 1925 Minecom was part political

manifesto and part autobiography containing discussions of history philosophy and economics In the book

Hitler explained the global conspiracy for world government and that it was directed by international Jewish bankers

He also wrote about the German loss of first world war the Jewish boss revolution the versile treaty and the

resulting hyperinflation that devastated Germany He accused the elite Marxist

Jews of Germany of controlling newspapers and banking fermenting wars and corrupting the art culture and

morality of Europe Minecom quickly grew in popularity which made Hitler a wealthy man Hitler was not the only man

who warned about the international jewelry In 1922 Henry Ford the American

industrialist founder of the Ford Motor Company published a four volume set of booklets called The International Jew

where he exposed the plans and operations of an organized Jewish globalist elite Fort's research revealed

a hidden influence over the American politics the Fed the press crime and

entertainment German nationalists would later study and hand out translated copies of Ford's

work Adolf Hitler himself had a copy in his office along with a photo of Ford

Ford himself referred to the problem of the rising influence of Jewish supremacism as the world's foremost

problem In 1931 Hitler said that he regarded Ford as an

inspiration To draw people away from both right nationalist and left socialist parties Hitler merely added

national and socialist to the party's name making it NSDAP Taking socialism without

internationalism and nationalism without capitalism Hitler said to the people that Germany's most precious possession

was their own people and that they all had to unite to save their own nation

The most obvious difference between national socialism and communism was that national socialism supported the

concept of private property and a market economy while communism abolished all private property and the government

controlled the economy through central planning Under communism all private property were ceased by the state Under

national socialism the private right of citizens were respected and protected While under communism there were no

private rights National socialism was shortly a radical movement in defense of

western civilization While communism was revolutionary movement dedicated to its

destruction Hitler also clarified in 1938 that socialism in national

socialism did not equal Marxist international socialism He said

socialists I define from the word social meaning in domain social equity A

socialist is one who serves the common good without giving up his individuality or personality or the product of his

personal efficiency Our adopted term socialists has nothing to do with

Martian socialism Marxism is anti-propy True socialism is not Marxism places no

value on the individual or individual effort or efficiency True socialism

values the individual and encourage him in individual efficiency at the same time holding that his interests as an

individual must be in conssonance with those of the community All great inventions discoveries achievements were

first a product of an individual brain It is charged against me that I am against property and that I am an

atheist Both charges are false [Music]

Speaking of humor I'm going to hear Hitler tomorrow Would you like to come hitler the anti-semite The National

Socialist Anti-semite Call them Nazis just to piss them off I hear he's fascinated The National Socialists did

not call themselves Nazis The term Nazi along with Nazism is a political epithet

invented in the 1920s by Conrad Hayden as propaganda against the NSDAP and

National Socialism Conrad Hayden was a Jewish journalist and a member of the competing party social democratic party

The term was a variant of the nickname for members of the social democratic party which at that time used to be

called Zuzi abbreviation of socialist Nazi was a political pun based upon the

Austria Bavarian slang word for simpleton or country pumpkin and derived

from the fairly common name Ignat It would be like saying Nazi Hence there

were no Nazis They were national socialists Hitler also designed the

NSDAP flag The swastika is an ancient symbol which means to be good good luck

and represented light consciousness and well-being

The German people were seriously embittered and depressed by the state of affairs in the Dwim Republic and they

looked for an explanation and solution to their situation National socialism was their only hope for savior With

decadence and all the undermining of family values so ingrained in Germany

the country had become an unsafe and unfit place for any German family By means of a democratic election Hitler

took over the leadership of Germany on January 30th 1933 Hitler is often called a dictator

but in fact he's the only wartime leader that could prove that he was democratically elected Hitler said

"Allow me four years and I swear to you as truly as I have now undertaken my duties I will depart It is not for any

reward or benefit that I've taken office but only for your sake It has been the

greatest decision of my whole life

Hitler came into true authoritative power in March 1933 He took over a

poverty-stricken sick and hopelessly bankrupt state with over 6 million Germans unemployed All German gold

reserves have been stolen by the victors of World War I as crushing reparation payments When Hitler kicked out the

destructive international bank in Cabal he became the only leader in history to arrest a Rothchild He later restricted

Jewish ownership of radio and newspapers Their Frankfurt school was closed down and its members fled to the United

States and migrated to major Jewish universities Hitler did not want to fall

back into the intra slavery of the international Jewish bankers He therefore immediately outlawed the

debt-based system i.e usery by punishment of death and created a new Deutsch mark that was backed only by

productive German physical and intellectual labor After having deleted the

parasitical bankers from the equation the German economic miracle took off almost

immediately Instead of borrowing from the banks at interest the government instead created a new monetary system

for the Germans called the labor treasury note Millions of Germans were

put to work and the workers were paid with the treasury certificates The government issued money was not backed

by gold but it was backed by something of real value It was essentially receipt for labor and materials delivered to the

government Hitler said "For every mark that was issued we required the equivalent of marks worth of work done

or goods produced." The workers then spent his certificates

on other goods and services creating more jobs for more people Hitler managed

to end the reparation payments from the Versile Treaty He rebuilt Germany into something better than ever and the

nation quickly rose from the ashes and healed its deep wounds The unemployment

problem was solved and the country was back on its feet It had a solid stable

currency no debt and no inflation Unemployment went from 50% down to less

than 2% in a few short years After 5 years Hitler had given 6 million Germans

work and full employment was reached Crime was almost non-existent Unemployment was a thing of the past and

there were no homeless and no beggars and billions for the bankers debts for

the people 1984 Sheldon Embry stated "Germany issued debt-free and interestf

free money from 1935 and on accounting for its startling rise from the depression to a world power in 5 years

Germany financed its entire government and war operations from 1935 to 1945

without gold and without debt And it took the whole capitalist and communist world to destroy the German power over

Europe and bring Europe back under the heel of the bankers Such history of money does not even appear in the

textbooks of public schools today The main priority for Hitler was

bringing back pride and belief in the German people again In a symbolic act of

national and spiritual rebirth university students organized the one-time book burning of degenerate

Marxist literature and books from the Institute of Sex Research in Berlin on May 10th

1933 Many of the National Socialist leaders were artists who looked at what needed to be improved in the world As a

result art and entertainment now reflected the true values of the German people again And there was a remarkable

emphasis on culture As a talented painter Hitler was well aware of the

Jewish Marxist influence behind the degradation of German art and culture Thus he invented the day of German art

deunst which was a parade held in Munich displaying an appreciation for art and

culture

theaters flourished The German movie industry produced about 100 feature films per year between 1933 and 1945

Some of the best classical recordings still existing were made in Hitler's German Actors from all over Europe

primarily from France Sweden and Italy were stars in German movies

Hitler transformed his country from an economically ruined land on the brink of breakdown civil war and total collapse

into the world's most advanced and prosperous country Everybody was in a very bad economic

situation There was unemployment there was hunger and um inflation And then

Hitler came and offered that he would make Germany as a great nation again and

he would give back our lost selfconidence and I myself I was

educated that my home country was something I have to serve to and I was

fatal liber and I was very proud of my country actually I was infected actually

by the singing and the crying and shouting to to greet him And I felt it

was something very touching And after he came to power he started immediately to

put in practice what he promised And he gave housing to the workers and employment to the unemployed And um

there was food and everything was in order again

It was a cultural and economic rebirth without parallel in the whole human history which inspired the rest of the

world to do the same Hitler's radical program restored German economic

independence ensured racial security for the people and diverted the nation's wealth from banking cartles to the

ordinary people Meanwhile the rest of the world still ruled under the Roachal Cabal was still in recession Hitler also

relaxed the strict gun control laws of the previous government allowing the people to defend themsel again False

claims are constantly made that Hitler could take power because he disarmed the German people But this is nonsense It

was the Wyim government that already had disarmed the German people before Gun clubs now open all over the Reich A man

who lived in Hitler's Germany was Hans Schmidt He said to be a boy or girl at

that time was wonderful And the Hitler's youth the differences between Christian denominations or the different German

states did not count We all truly felt that we were members of one body of

people one nation Youth host were opened all over the Reich enable us to hike

from one beautiful town to another seeing our father land Every effort was

made to strengthen our minds and bodies Contrary to what is said today we were encouraged to become free in spirit and

not succumb to peer or authority pressure 1st of May 1933 was made into a

holiday for the workers Hitler implemented the strength through joy program which was a generous social

program that enabled the common man to have affordable leisure activities such as concerts plays libraries day trips

and cruises to other countries For the first time in the world millions of workers and their children could access

a foreign vacation almost for free The first vacation cruise were built for the German workers The favorite destinations

were the Portuguese island and Madiraa as well as the Spanish island and port

cities The National Socialist Program is a manual for national recovery Its lesson can be applied to any nation

today Drawing on the program Germany in less than 36 months enjoyed full employment and the world's highest

standard of living

[Music]

Hitler's way was called the folks economic To alleviate the greatest need of the German people winter assistant

work was also immediately called into being No one shall starve or freeze sounded the motto

He

is als rise and

armor heaven

[Applause]

[Applause] Donations were sent to the poorest in

Germany's cities and mountain regions It was a first rate social action that had great success The poor people of these

regions then created small items such as wood carvings glassware etc as token for

the donations received This earned them work and bread and the action spurred the whole nation and the German folk to

stand united In order to provide work and bread to the millions of unemployed the construction of Autoband began using

only German material The new road system was made so that it did not destroy either the German landscape or wildlife

habitats nor forests The price per automo was between 1,350 and 1,600 rice

marks But Hitler thought the prices were too high for the common family Thus Hitler together with Ferdinand Porsche

dreamt up and designed the people's car the Volkswagen This would be the most built and most economical car in the

world At that time it cost 995 marshm paid off in minor payments Volkswagen

was a word that Hitler himself personally chose Germany was a Christian nation of which more than 46 million

belonged to the German evangelical Protestant church and 30 million to the Roman Catholical faith About 2,500 new

churches were built in Germany Hitler himself believed in positive Christianity and he regularly visited

the church

What was he like as a man the secrets at least found him a very friendly charming

polite and patient chief He has even a

sense of humor and we never experienced any loud words or something

unfriendly and to me as I was the youngest he had actually more or less a

fatherly behavior I actually I liked him and I felt well in his company and I

enjoyed talking to him and listen to his more or less monologues [Music]

A lot of people of course have seen History Channel documentaries and scare pieces on the mass media that give a

distorted view of what national socialism actually is First of all national socialism is an ideology about

life It's about the cultivation of life of building strong families of building families that are able to raise good

children children that are moral children that are healthy and children that are on a path of virtue to be able

to build a better and brighter future for the nation It's about cooperation specifically class cooperation gender

cooperation and cooperation throughout all members of society National Socialism views the nation like a body

and a body takes all different parts The liver is not more important than the brain or the heart or the arm or the leg

Everything works in tandem with one another to be able to be life We as national socialists support every single

member of our community as being part of an extended family The working class has a responsibility and a duty to be able

to work hard but they also have a right to economic justice to having their voices be heard within society and

bosses have a right to be able to make profits within their corporations and companies But they also need to ensure

that they're putting the best interests of the worker families and the nation first We believe in taking from the

right nationalism without capitalism and from the left socialism without internationalism At the end of the day

national socialism and its economic theory is about putting the nation first because the nation is your family

National socialism is also about rejecting capitalism and communism Capitalism and communism are two

ideologies that take the human being and make him a cog within a greater machine Communism wages a war of the poor

against the rich And capitalism is a war of the rich against the poor Both of these are Jewish ideologies and

ideologies that poison the national community They tear apart the working class They tear apart families And they

turn the nation into one giant fire cell to be able to say that whoever has the most money or the most power is able to

loot and pillage it National socialism says that the national community has to work together that we need to ensure

that everyone has rights and duties and responsibilities to one another and this in turn creates a healthier society

National socialism believes in the cultivation of virtue We reject the degeneracy that we see in the modern

west the pornography that we see on our television screens the radical individualism within our society and

instead say we want to be able to cultivate and activate within ourselves natural beauty We want to be able to

build beautiful art We want to be able to build beautiful cities and beautiful communities This is about the

cultivation of what is good And everything about capitalism and communism and the Jewish power structure

is about destroying what is good We see this in the modern west Whether it's the importation of foreign peoples foreign

ideologies radical feminism abortion and a culture that supports death instead of

life This is an ideology of death a death cult that is destroying the

western peoples in the western world We as national socialists support an ideology of life of rebirth and

rebuilding ourselves and our nations We're an ideology that believes in peace throughout the entire world General Leon

Degr said that national socialism and racialism is about lifting your own people up and we want the same for every

single group of people We want every single ethnicity and ethnic community around the world to be able to be

stronger to be able to chart their own destiny and to be able to work together against the international Jew work

against the international capitalists and work against a system that breaks apart nations and families Finally

national socialism is an ideology that isn't an ideology It follows natural law

These are principles that are within all of us We as national socialists whether we are Christians or pagans or simply

agnostics understand that there is a greater power and there's greater principles that drive us in this world

As an extended family and a national community we're not at war with one another over differences on religion

differences in subculture or differences in class We understand that working together as a team is what will make our

nation strong National socialism is building a better and brighter future So

you might hear a lot of lies in the media but what the truth is is we are the only ideology that can defeat the

international Jew and the international capitalists Not just in our nation but in all nations to bring about an earth

where we take care of the environment We take care of animals We take care of the water we drink and the air we breathe

And we take care of our blood and our culture National socialism makes you a

steward You have responsibilities and duties It is not an ideology for the weak It is an ideology for those that

love their faith their family and their

fault The term democracy means something it did not mean 100 years or even 50

years ago In fact the national socialists strived to revive and restore

the term democracy to its original and rightful meaning The national socialist form of democracy was based on the

principle of community of the people The national socialist electoral system was

not based on the parliamentary system but was nonetheless democratic The national system of government was

largely based on referenda in which the really important issues of the day were debated and voted upon by the German

people Thus the national socialist form of democracy was more pure and more representative than that of today

Superman In 1933 Hitler passed a law that enabled married couples to obtain

interest free loans minimum 1,000 rich mark equals to 9 months salary to set up

homes and start families For each child birth the couple was allowed to keep 250

marks and did not have to repay it Newly married couples with children received these generous loans repayable in 10

years so they could buy a house or apartment The birth of the first child would cancel a quarter of the loan four

children would cancel the entire debt Over a 10-year period a family with four children would earn more than the amount

of the loan In the eyes of the national socialist women were viewed as the preservers of the tribe the guardians of

future generations Everywhere in Germany houses and apartments were built for their

workers Villages of small single family homes were set up The monthly payments were set so low that practically

everyone could afford his own house All houses were naturally constructed according to the highest standards of

public health Before the end of 1933 Hitler succeeded in building 200,000

buildings in accordance with his building program Within 4 years nearly 1.5 million were built for the German

people The monthly rent for a worker was only about an eight of his monthly

earnings The farmer's economic situation was also drastically improved In 1933

alone 17,611 houses were built for farmers Within 3 years 91,000 such houses were

[Music] built The National Socialists were the first to actively campaign against

smoking and personally funded the institute for the struggle against tobacco Germany became the first in the

world to ban smoking on public transit In 1937 his government enacted the first

law which prohibited the sale of alcohol to minors and enacted stiff penalties for drunken driving They also introduced

the first blood test for automobile drivers suspected of driving drunk Adafller was the first person to

create a law against the mistreatment of animals recognizing it to be evil A law

imposing a total ban on animal experiments was enacted The National Socialist declaring end to the

unbearable torture and suffering in animal experiments Guring announced in a radio broadcast "An absolute impermanent

ban on vivisection is not only a necessary law to protect animals and show sympathy with their pain but is

also a law for humanity [Music]

itself The inhuman ritual slaughter of animals as kosher and halal was totally

banned The rights animal protection act was enacted Germany even hosted an

international conference on animal protection in Berlin Education on animal protection laws were introduced at

primary secondary and college levels Animal protection was accepted as a subject to be taught in public schools

and universities in Germany With all of these fantastic achievements German self-confidence national pride and

happiness skyrocketed Germany were now free and independent without having to be in debt to the bankers anymore Hitler

became a living legend to his people as his policies put Germany back on its feet and it was even named the man of

the year in 1938 Ex- Prime Minister David Lord

George said "It is not the Germany of the decade that followed the war broken dejected and bowed down with a sense of

apprehension and impotence It is now full of hope and confidence One man has

accomplished this miracle The old trust him the young idolize him It is not the

admiration according to a popular leader It is the worship of a national hero who have saved his country from utter

desperence and degradation I have never met a happier

[Music] people So what we know about Adolf Hitler is like what we know about

history The victors of course write the history don't they they write the history and they tell us a narrative and

we're supposed to swallow that [ __ ] as if it's true The major crime of Adolf Hitler was that he got out He got

Germany out of a banking debt that was drowning the German people Drowning the

German people in a cesspool of moral decay drowning in debt And he had the

nerve to actually say [ __ ] off to the bankers and start printing their own

money And Germany went from a destitute postworld war country that was

drowning Germans starving no jobs nothing And he got them out of that debt

and literally brought that nation back to a powerhouse within several years just by using their own money supply

That's the real crime that Adolf Hitler committed Now I could sit here and talk in really exciting senses a little bit

more about everything we've been taught about World War II and the Holocaust but let us suffice to say that it fits in

line with virtually everything we've been told about history in general

[ __ ] [ __ ] And John F Kennedy had the

courage and the balls and integrity to bypass the Federal Reserve Bank to bypass this financial system and he was

dead within 6 months And there ain't no coincidence there Definitely

not We only need to do one thing to turn it all around One

thing Let's confront that financial system Let us print our own

money [Music]
