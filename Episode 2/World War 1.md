there were many different motives for why the first world war was fought since 1871 Germany had emerged as a powerhouse

upsetting the longestablished balance of power sheen in Europe the established great powers Britain France and Russia

joined together in 1914 to destroy this new rival on the 28th of June 1914

Gabriel Princip a Bosian Serb and a failed student assassinated the Archduke

France Ferdinand successor to the AustriaHungarian

throne austriahungary had signed a defensive pact with Germany which Germany in 1909 reconfirmed by declaring

that Germany was bound to stand by AustriaHungary even if it had started a war austria declared war on Serbia which

started the first world war throughout the whole war Germany wanted peace and had nothing to gain in the conflict

whatsoever even if Germany was well on its way to win the war in December of 1916 Kaiser Willham offered to negotiate

peace with the intent powers by December 1916 Germany had a clear advantage

france had suffered horrible losses russia faced internal Bolsheik uprising

and revolutionary chaos and had to withdraw its troops britain was under the Yubot blockade and not one inch of

Germany had been occupied germany still offered generous peace terms kaiser

William was ready to just call off the war and return to how things were before

that was when the Zionist Jews Chime Wisemen and Nathan Sakalov approached

the British with a dirty deal they offered to use their global influence to bring the US into the war on Britain's

side while undermining and destroying Germany from within in exchange for US

entry the British would steal Palestine from Ottoman Turkey which was Germany's ally and then allow the Jews to settle

there the deal was called the Balffor Declaration and was delivered to the Baron Walter Rothschild jews in London

then sent messages to Lewis Brandai one of the Jewish members of the Supreme Court instructing him to pressure

President Wilson to join the war other scientist power brokers such as Bernard Baroo Paul Warberg and Jacob Schiff also

pressured America to join the British government agreed that they would support the Jewish homeland in Palestine

in exchange for the powerful Jewish lobby in America getting the USA to join the Allies british airplanes dropped

leaflets over Germany printed in Yiddish the bow for leaflets to win Jewish support in Germany by promising the Jews

a homeland in Palestine after they have won the war

and here it is the Balffor Declaration what do you feel when you when you see it here i genuinely feel it's one of the

most extraordinary moments in the history of the Jewish people if you think it took 3,000 years uh to get to

this and then you say how did this novel happen as the most

incredible piece of opportunism i mean if you think you had an impoverished

would be scientist invitesman who somehow gets to England meets a few

people including members of my family seduces them he has such great charm and

conviction he gets to Belf and he unbelievably persuades Belf and

Lloyd George the prime minister and most of the ministers that this idea of um

the national home for um Jews should be allowed to take place

after the deal was made Jewish owned media immediately unleashed a ton of anti-German propaganda depicting the

Germans as barbaric hunts this was done to get the public support for American

intervention in the war while the Zionist and Jewish Marxists of Germany started to destabilize Germany from

within through several strikes within the arms industry factories which weakened the German war effort if

America wouldn't have been tricked into the war it would have been stopped right there and then and millions of European

lives would have been

saved american entrance into the war was then carried out as promised lord Balfur

was assuring the scientists that Britain would fulfill its end of the deal after the war had ended the theft and

overthrowing of Palestine from the Ottoman [Music]

Turks before more European blood would be shed on European soil both Germany

and AustriaHungary again asked for a peaceful resolution

wilson was forced to admit that Germany and AustriaHungary had indeed expressed general peace proposals but he casually

dismissed them all lying about how beautiful the post-war peace was going to be like wilson managed to trick so

many warrants into an unconditional surrender and disarmament in November of that same year

[Music] 1918 communists and scientists within

Germany stabbed their countrymen in the back marxist trade union leaders ordered factory strikes which deprived German

troops of their vital supplies german morale and industrial output quickly fell germany laid down the weapons and

wished for an honorary peace after the war the Tresionist betrayal of 1918

became known as the stab in the back germany had simply been betrayed from within by scientists and communists and

consequently they were all tied together as enemies because they wish to see Germany fail in Israel today Balfford

Day November I widely celebrated the Palestinian Arabs observe it as a day of

grief [Music]

in January 1919 the victors met at the Paris Peace Conference to financially

crush Germany and determine the new borders of the defeated nation germany was not even invited and would not have

any say in the final decisions as the globalist ripped Germany to pieces the

conference also created the basis for a future world government the League of Nations the Sionist delegation that was

present that had brought America into the war also made sure that former Arab territories of the Ottoman Empire were

separated from Turkish rule and broken up to into small states so that Palestine could become a British

protectorate the Jews then claimed to a piece of Palestine guaranteed by the League of Nations exactly as Herzel had

predicted in 1887 out of the Paris Peace Conference came the brutal and notorious

Treaty of Versal on 20th of June 1919 and the Treaty of Santium on 20th of

September the same year even liberal historians recognized the evil of the treaty today a Germany that did not want

any war that had tried to avoid war and had offered to make peace on numerous occasions throughout the whole war was

now totally disarmed germany was forced to pay massive war reparations in the form of money and

natural resources the crushing debt payments 100 billion marks equal to $1

trillion in modern currency devastated the German economy and soon caused a

hyperinflationary monetary collapse the total sum of war operations demanded from Germany were about 226 billion

marks the aim was to financially break Germany john Mayor Kanes predicted that

these harsh reparations would lead to the financial collapse of Germany germany's armed forces were

restricted to 100,000 men intended solely for police duties within the country and conscription was prohibited

all Germany colonies were taken away from her the same thing happened with a number of German areas in Europe in

total Germany had to give up 13% of her lands several million Germans ended up

stranded outside of the German Empire and millions were forcefully expelled from their homes germany also lost large

parts of their industry when key iron war and coal assets disappeared the

industrial German rhinland would be occupied by French troops for 15 years

the treaty of Versal was a devastating peace treaty for Germany but the agreement also had serious economic

consequences not only for Germany but also for Europe and the world as Germany was such an important brick in the world

economy the treaty contained 440 clauses 414 out of them were specifically

dedicated to punishing Germany for a war that the nation was totally innocent

of in the Times 1919 Winston Churchill expressed the ultimate goal of the

treaty should Germany do business again in the next 50 years we have led this war in vain

[Music]

the encirclement and unprecedented hunger blockade killed almost a million of German children women old men and the

most fragile of society the Allies now had only one fixed intention to prolong

the power of Versale and to destroy Germany for good germany was now completely disarmed

and she had been damaged on all sides and had no way of defending herself at any moment could her neighbors decide to

attack her because of the enormous reparation costs to be paid in gold

there was no longer any backing for the mark this led to inflation which totally wiped out all the German savings germany

1922 to 23 faced the most horrific hyperinflation the world has ever seen

and the German mark became worthless unemployment hunger and a hopeless future distinguished the Wimmer Republic

to the German people suicide rates were high unemployment topped 30% as

desperate Germans committed suicide birth rates were extremely low anarchy and chaos was in the air there was

nothing the disarmed humiliated and hungry German people could do about it as communists even seized parts of many

cities in 1929 the Federal Reserve caused the Great Depression the

researcher Boris Borisovv and his article titled the American famine estimated the victims of the financial

crisis in the US at over 7 million people the globalist powers had now

managed to orchestrate yet another famine that killed millions of white Europeans like in Russia before ben

Barernanke said regarding the Great Depression "We did it." By we Bernank of

course meant the Jewish leaders of the Federal Reserve system back in Germany the effects of the engineered stock

market crash was even worse than in any other country as the life savings of the people were wiped out as prices doubled

every 2 days for 20 straight months 1922 inflation was spiraling

wildly out of control people would be paid in the morning and have suitcase

fulls of banknotes and they would have to then run to the shops because in the time between being paid and the time

when they bought their goods their food the prices would have risen berlin was in a state of total total chaos hundreds

of thousands of dispossessed starving in the streets and at the same time you had

very rich people so you got on the one hand the poor eating turnip soup the

butchers selling crows squirrels even rats and on the other side people who

could afford it eating the most sumptuous meals like they never paused for

thought the Germans had to pay two to 20 billion marks for a single postage stamp

a loaf of bread cost 2 billion marks a pound of butter cost two trillion marks

the German middle class was the worst hit and saw all their savings and businesses being destroyed starving

families and their children banged on the streets many Germans referred to their

devalued money as udetsen Jewish confetti because whilst

the Germans were starving the jewelry lived their golden luxury life in the republic germany was totally bankrupt in

the end of 1929 the Jewish statician Alfred Marcus estimated the average Jewish income for

1930 as three times the average income for the rest of the population the

industries as in the rur were all bankrupt and workers were all laid off in their millions in January 1933 over 6

million Germans were unemployed although the Jews comprise less than 1%

of the German population the political influence of the Jews in the Wimmer Republic was enormously out of

proportion to their numbers in the population they managed to control over 50% of the media in the press and 70% of

all the judges 57% of the metal trade 22% of grain and 39% of the textile

trade german banking and finance was under the total control of Jews they were particularly evident in the private

banking in Berlin which in 1923 had 150 private Jewish banks as opposed to only

11 private non-Jewish banks four of the six members of the controlling board of

the rich tag directors were Jews including Jacob Goulmid and Rudolfph

Havstein in order for anyone to control people's minds one has to control the

press and media jewish domination of the press and the public mind began with

Reuters news agency in 1865 established by the Jew Paul Reutder born Israel Ber

Yosphhat in 1865 the Reuters Telegram Company was the first major news

organization in the world almost every major news outlet in the world today subscribes to Reuters services which

operates in over 200 cities in 94 countries in about 20 languages

the Washington Post was controlled by scientist Federal Reserve chairman Eugene Mayor in 1940 Major would fire

the Washington Post pacifist editor for refusing to endorse US involvement in World War II post would later be handed

down to Mayor's daughter the late Katherine Mayor Graham

in 1896 Adolf Os bought the New York Times and formed the New York Times

company the O Sulsberger family one of the United States newspaper dynasties

has owned the New York Times ever since for 117 years America's most influential

news source has been in the hands of the same family in 1926 the Jew David Sarna

formed NBC the first major broadcast network in the US in 1928 the

27-year-old Jewish businessman William S paley secured majority ownership of the

CBS radio network haley expanded CBS into a national powerhouse with 114

affiliate stations it is very important to remember that the four most powerful media sources the Washington Post the

New York Times NBC and CBS were now all under total Jewish ownership and control

jewish daily bulletin on July 27th 1935 said "There is only one power which

really counts the power of political pressure we Jews are the most powerful people on earth because we have this

power and we know how to apply it." The two largest German newspapers

before 1933 were also in Jewish hands leopold Olstein August Shur and Rudolfph

Moss these Jews had a virtual monopoly on the German press their main publication was the Berliner Tagablat

the editor of this paper was the Wolf a Jew who also took a prominent part in

politics all editorials all policy all thought and every single sphere of major

influence had now fallen under Jewish control of the 29 legitimate theaters in

Berlin 23 had Jewish directors in 1931 of 144 film scripts made into movies 119

were written by Jews and 77 were produced by Jews

when you ask what have the Germans done to the Jews you must always ask what have you done the Jews to the

Germans in 1918 Lenin and Trosky established the Communist International

also known as the comm turn in Moscow Russia in the days following the Bolevik

revolution in Russia Trosky promoted the idea of a permanent revolution which

meant that the Soviet Union had to politically provoke other nations throughout the world to start their own

bolshevik revolutions the comet turn stated openly that its intention was to

fight for the creation of an international Soviet republic i.e a

communist world government commiter affiliated parties formed in France

Italy China Germany Spain Belgium the US and other nations the ideology of

communism spread like a poison through Europe the author Arenst Elmhurst

explained in 1938 that socialism communism and bulsheism in reality are

only links in the plan of world embracing Judaism with its final purpose

of forcing the entire world under Jewish domination following the Russian revolution of 1917 revolutionary Jewish

communist leaders Carl Lee and Rosa Luxembourg led a group of Jewish

communists Kurt Eisner Paul Levie France Meering Wilhen Peak Rickard Müller Emil

Bach Gustav Landau Eugene Lavine and Emil Ahorn to attempt a violent and

bloody communist revolution in Germany as well

they were heroically stopped in 1919 by the veterans in the German fry

corpse the Jew Bella [ __ ] instigated a Jewish revolution and took over the

leadership of Hungary in March 1919 after months of red terror and massacres

of Christians the Hungarians managed to fight back hungarian Rear Admiral Miklas

Horthy formed a national army to fight the Bolsheviks with the support of the Romanian army Horthie managed to take

back the country on August 1st

1919 in Italy Jewish-led communists committed mass murders in Sarana Moda

Bologona Patro Dana and Milan but were defeated by Mussolini's fascist forces

fascism was a movement to save Europe from communism today thanks to our

globalist media almost everyone thinks that fascism was something

horrible fascism is shortly a defender of the nation its culture and people

under fascism government plays a key role in monitoring film theater art literature music education etc in order

to maintain a high moral standard keep things clean and respectable promote a strong sense of patriotism and honor and

prevent the spreading of decadence which corrupt society from

within even Winston Churchill thought that fascism proved the necessary antidote to the communist poison he said

of Mussolini Roman genius the greatest lawgiver among men speaking in Rome on

January 20 1927 Winston Churchill said "If I'd been an Italian I am sure that I

should have been wholeheartly with you from the start to the finish italy has shown that there is a way of fighting

the subversive forces which can rally the masses of the people properly led to

value in which to defend the honor and stability of civilized society hereafter

no great nation will be unprovided with an ultimate means of protection against

the cancerous growth of bism 12 years later Winston Churchill

will align his country and people with bulcheism oswald Mosley was the fascist

leader of Britain and try to save his country as well but never managed to get enough power cornelio Kadrano said

"Fascism means first of all defending your nation against the dangers that threaten it it means the destruction of

these dangers and the opening of a free way to life and glory for your

nation." Jewish Bolsheviks then attempted to take Spain in 1936 which

led to the bloody Spanish civil war the Jews launched an orgy of mass murder

rape and destruction the Jew laba Lassarvich Feldbin Soviet Red Army

officer was chief of Soviet security in the Spanish Civil War over 20,000

churches across Spain were destroyed 6,832 Spanish priests 3,000 monks 300

nuns and 13 bishops were killed some 4,000 laymen were also murdered for

helping or hiding nuns or priests felbin was one of the masterminds behind the massacres in 1939 the devout Roman

Catholic General Francisco Franco stepped up and created a united nationalist group and managed to save

Spain from a communist takeover franco had the support of Antonio Salasar in

Portugal Benito Mussolini in Italy and Adolf Hitler in Germany on February 8th

1920 Sir Winston Churchill expressed his alarm over the world developments in an interview published in the Sunday

Illustrated Herald London from the days of Adam Spartacus Vice to those of K

Marx to those of Trosky Bella [ __ ] Rosa Luxembourg and Emma Goldman this

worldwide conspiracy for the overthrow of civilization and for the reconstruction of society on the basis

of arrested development of envious malevolence and impossible equality has

been steadily growing

ideological and cultural subversion is a subtle gradual and persistent undermining internally of another

group's values strength and ways of life with the aim of making them vulnerable

this is the strategy that the communists used when they infiltrated and took over societies from within starting with

Germany the four stages of subversion are demoralization

destabilization crisis and normalization

when uh the Soviets use the phrase ideological subversion what do they mean by ideological subversion is is the

process which is legitimate over and open you you can see it with

your own eyes all all you have to do all American mass media has to do is to unplug their bananas from their ears

open up their eyes and they can see it only about 15% of time money and

manpower is spent on espionage as such the other 85% is a slow process which we

call either ideological subversion or active measures act in the language of

of the KGB or psychological warfare what it basically means is to change the

perception of reality of every American to such an extent that despite

of the abundance of information no one is able to come to sensible conclusions in the interests of

defending themselves their families their community and their country

it's a great brainwashing uh process which goes very slow and it's divided in

in four basic stages uh the first one being demoralization it takes from 15 to 20

years to demoralize a nation why that many years because this is the minimum

number of years which requires to educate one generation of students in

the country of of of your enemy exposed to the ideology of the enemy in other

words Marxism Leninism ideology is being pumped into the soft heads of of of at

least three generations of American students without being challenged or counterbalanced by the basic values of

Americanism American patriotism the demoralization process in the United States is basically completed already uh

for the last 25 years actually it's overfulfilled because demoralization now

reaches such areas where previously not even comrade and drop off and and all his experts would would even dream of

such a tremendous success most of it is done by Americans to Americans thanks to

lack of moral standards as I mentioned before uh exposure to true information

does not matter anymore a person who was demoralized is unable to assess true

information the facts tell nothing to him uh even if I shower him with

information with with authentic proof with documents with pictures even if I

take him by force to the Soviet Union and show him concentration camp he will refuse to believe it until he he's going

to receive a kick in the in his fat bottom when a military boot crashes his

then he will understand but not before that that's the tragic of the situation of demoralization the next stage is

destabilization this time suburer does not care about your ideas and the patterns of your

consumption whether you eat junk food and get fat and flabby it doesn't matter anymore this time and it takes only from

two to five years to destabilize a nation uh it's what what matters is

essentials economy foreign relations defense systems

uh and you can see it quite clearly that in some areas uh in such sensitive areas

as as uh defense and economy the influence of Marxist Leninist ideas in

the United States is absolutely fantastic i I could never believe it 14 years ago when I landed uh in this part

of the world that the process will go that fast uh the next stage of course is

crisis it it it may take only up to six weeks to to bring a country to the verge of crisis you can see it in in Central

America now and after crisis with a violent change of of power structure and

economy you have so-called the period of normalization it may last indefinitely

this is what will happen in United States if you allow all the schmucks to bring the country to

crisis to promise people all kind of goodies and the paradise on earth uh to

to destabilize your economy to eliminate the principle of free market competition

and to put a big brother government in Washington DC who will promise lots of

things never mind whether the promises are fulfillable or not your leftists in

in United States all these professors and all these beautiful civil rights defenders they are instrumental in the

process of the of the u uh subversion only to destabilize the nation when

their job is completed they are not they are not needed anymore they know too much some of them when when they get

disillusioned when they see that Marxist Lenin has come to power obviously they get offended they think that they will

come to power that will never happen of course they will be lined up against the wall and shot

towards the end of 1922 the communist international kami turn began to

consider how they would succeed taking over Europe in the most effective way on Lennis initiative a meeting was

organized at the Marx Engles Institute in Moscow the aim of the meeting was to start the Marx Cultural Revolution among

those present at the meeting was George Lucash a Jewish Hungarian aristocrat and a son of a banker in the summer of 1924

Lukak moved to Germany here he held the first meeting of a group of communist

oriented intellectuals this gathering was to lead the foundation of the Frankfurt School the institute had been

officially established and funded by the Jewish millionaire Felix Whale this institute was called the Institute for

Social Research later it will be known as the Frankfurt School these new

Marxists under the direction of Max Horheimer believed that Europeans were

too attached to tradition race nation family and faith to be able to accept

communism antonio Grahamshy while in prison described that Marxism and

communism could only flourish after a long march through the cultural institutions only then after they had

corrupted all western values and made life impossible for us could they impose the dictatorship of the proletariat this

was also what the Fabian socialists did to weaken the countries and slowly implementing international communism the

mantra would now be change and destroy western culture before communism would

be accepted george Lucas believed that for a new communist culture to emerge

the existing European culture had to be destroyed there is no other way to get

control of a society with strong moral values than to weaken those values he

said "I saw the revolutionary destruction of society as the one and only solution to the cultural

contradictions of the epoch such a worldwide overturning of values cannot take place without the annulation of the

old values and the creation of new ones by the revolutionaries." Willie Munenber said

"We must organize the intellectuals and use them to make western civilization

stink." Only then after they had corrupted all its values and made life impossible can we impose the

dictatorship of a proletariat out of this came cultural

Marxism the subversive ideology which meant that gender sexual orientation

family race culture or religion every single aspect of a white person's

identity was to be questioned every norm or standard in a society challenged and

ideally altered and demolished in order to benefit supposedly oppressed groups

instead of Europeans this would supposedly create a society in which the Jews would not be seen as an outside

distinctive class where they could feel safer to climb to the highest positions in society without encountering much

opposition from Europeans the entire purpose of cultural Marxism was to

delegitimize and banish European ethnic interests and replace them with

minorities when I started writing about Jewish intellectual movements I realized I couldn't just go around counting Jews

and what I had to show was that you had a cohesive core of Jews that were that

were mutually reinforcing each other that they were the backbone of this

movement and I had to show that these people identified as Jews and I had to show that they viewed what they were

doing as furthering specific Jewish goals for example one of the most common

things was they were concerned about anti-semitism quite a bit of my writing in in my book

the culture of critique was to show that the Jews who were the center of these Jewish intellectual movements were very

concerned about issues like anti-semitism that they were trying to develop theories in which anti-semitism

was a pathology in which anti-semitism had no intellectual basis in which it

was just morally beyond the pale important thing was to show that Jewish

identification was important and furthering of of a specific Jewish goal

now that's not to say that this was a a goal that all Jews have they were not saying that all Jews had are anything as

a matter of fact for example psychoanalysis had specific goals they were concerned about uh about

anti-semitism but that doesn't mean that most Jews uh even believed in psychoanalysis or anything else we're

talking about a cohesive group of people it's very easy to show that the Frankfurt school intellectuals Max

Horheimer um Adorno and these other uh prominent Frankfurt school people had

strong Jewish identities france Boas the famous anthropologist very strong Jewish

identity a very deep concern with specific Jewish issues like anti-semitism and that they saw their

particular intellectual uh endeavors as advancing specific Jewish goals there's

nothing wrong with advancing your own goals that's what we all do the only thing is that those goals often times

conflict with those of other people and so uh essentially for example at the Frankfurt school he developed an

ideology in which any group identification that a non-Jew had was

considered a pathology so that if uh if someone like me identified as a white

person and had you know felt I had interest as a white person well that was

viewed as a psychiatric disorder there was never any mention that about Jews that strong with a very strong sense of

of Jewish identity and Jewish interest that there was anything wrong with them it was it was an ideology that uh frame

be that that really frame adaptive behaviors of non-Jews as pathological

even even family uh family life that that that non-Jews with strong family

ties and so on there's something wrong with them their families were authoritarian and they did all the

psychoanalytic stuff to to try to prove that that sort of thing but it was just you know made up science and no

scientific basis at all after March there were a group of Marxists who

wisely decided that you could bring this collectivist society to a nation through

culture as well by introducing certain values and concepts that would break

down the family for example if you could somehow break down the family unit so

that it was no longer self- sustaining and no longer valued in a society then

that would leave individual members who formally could turn to the family for

support in times of need they would now be cut loose they would be without a

place to go in times of need so now they have to turn to the government so cultural Marxism would be that type of

activity in any society that breaks down the culture in such a way so that

people instinctively turn to government as an alternative for the support that

they otherwise would have this is done through art it's through music it's through literature it's through motion

pictures and that kind of thing the implanting of certain ideas and concepts which make them very ripe for the

philosophy of collectivism and makes them very ripe for turning to government as the big daddy the big solver of all

problems collectivism implies that if something is important enough then the state

should step in and make sure that everybody conforms whether they want to or not the whole point of a socialistic

society is to do four things markx talks about destroying the family two

destroying property three destroying religion and four destroying the nation

and what you end up with is the goolog where the whole country becomes the Soviet Union

almost every movie that Hollywood puts out today must depict characters with at least one of the following attributes

one the protagonist and/or the antagonist are divorced

two the female is portrayed as dominant controlling violent and/or one up on men

three the male is portrayed as aloof feminine overly sensitive and/or

cheating four somewhere in the family at least one of its immediate members must

be a lesbian gay bisexual or a women's liver often attributes are mixed in

various proportions and even mixed with a touch of schizophrenia as males and

females swap roles in fluoresence one of the big themes in in movies in

recent years has been that uh the the whites have almost tended to disappear from positions of being heroes of being

sort of you know idealized or something like that uh in the place you have people like Morgan Freeman who's cast as

very responsible moral uh godlike figure and so on or you have action figures

like Will Smith and um Wesley Snipes and so on so you have an awful lot of uh

sort of displacement of whites as as media images uh in the last few decades

and whites are all often criminals you often have blonde hair blue-eyed uh people um playing criminal roles playing

people who are dishonest or weak or subservient uh and the black characters

being very strong very wise you'll often see of course black computer technicians

black scientists um black uh teachers and professors who

are very wise and understand everything whites are portrayed as uh stupid often

times as irresponsible oftentimes as needing the advice of of black people or

other minorities um it's really the the visual displacement of whites from

center stage to the periphery and I think this is preparing the white people

for their displacement in the culture as a whole y Sambari Swedish Jewish author and

journalist explains the drive behind the push for destroying white countries by means of cultural Marxism historically

Jews had always thrived in nations and empires with multicultural pluralistic and tolerant environments while they

fared badly in strong ethnic or nationalistic societies European Jews

have always been theatic stranger or other therefore by definition a society

where the stranger is welcome is good for the Jews the future of European jury

is dependent on our ability to shape a multicultural pluralistic and diverse

society the website smashculturalmarxism.com explains the

phenomenon of cultural Marxism extremely well cultural Marxism or cultural

bullsheism degenerate culture seeks to destroy everything good about society

what holds it together what helps it to advance what promotes intelligence and beauty it seeks to degenerate society

and take it to a lower form where people are less intelligent and more animal it's based on the Marxist lie that

everything good about society is all form of oppression every time anyone

promotes culture Marxism they use the same line claiming it's about freeing people from oppression these common

cultural Marxist themes are all promoted by the same lie that they are done in

the name of freedom liberalism sexual perversion degenerate art degenerate

music mass immigration anti-intelligence and the promotion of people acting like animals corrupted versions of feminism

multiculturalism oppressing people of European ancestry and destroying nationalism and destroying non-Jewish

religion cultural Marxism is largely a synthesis of Marx and Freud it is

Marxism is applied in the cultural sphere and the analyzes and control of the media art theater film and other

cultural institutions in society often with an emphasis on class gender and

race as a form of political analyzis cultural Marxism gained strength in the 1920s and was the model used by a group

of intellectuals in Germany known as the Frankfurt School and later by another group of intellectuals at the center of

contemporary cultural studies in Birmingham England the fields of cultural studies and critical theory are

rooted in and influenced by work of cultural Marxism cultural Marxism is formulated as a way to subvert European

nations and civilization using methods other than direct political action

theodora Adorno was also an original member of the Frankfurt School with the help of the American Jewish Committee he

wrote a book entitled The Authoritarian Personality the book's purpose was to make every group affiliation sound as if

it were a sign of mental disorder patriotism religion family and race

loyalty were signs of a dangerous and defective authoritarian personality the

school's critical theory preached that the authoritarian personality was a product of the patriarchal family this

was one of the basic principles of cultural Marxism the need to break down the family unit

frankfurt school as base developed the ideology that you had to sort of reject

your family by rejecting your family you would then u be more likely to uh accept

or you would be less likely to be anti-Jewish and you know it's a remarkable thing because they never

suppose that Jewish children should reject their parents or you're going to promulgate Judaism to the next

generation you have to have children who identify with their parents but the authoritarian personality identifying

with your parents who were Christian especially was the epitome of pathology

this had to be eradicated you see with the with the authoritarian personality is holding out individualism radical

individualism as a cultural ideal now of course individualism is a long roots in

in European society but what you're talking about with radical individualism is giving up all your allegiances you

just become the isolated individual this is not a prescription that Jews have ever adopted i mean if there's anything

that is characteristic of Judaism it's a strong sense of identification with a group so essentially this is a

prescription for the behavior of of Gentiles that would uh essentially make

them less likely to have allegiances with other groups because what from the standpoint of Jews what is the the most

terrifying thing is a a group of non-Jews united by an ideology where they have a strong sense of group

membership and which Jews are viewed negatively i mean the paradigm of that would be of course national socialism in

Germany from 1933 to 1945 fundamentally what Nazism was about was

having a strong sense of being a member of a nation having a strong sense that you're part of an ingroup and these

other people uh are not you know you're you're not on their page uh Jews

especially and so uh one way to get rid of that basically is to advocate

individuals for everybody get rid of your allegiances don't have any rel any allegiance to religion country race even

family and again one of the the points I keep making there is that this is completely hypocritical because to be a

strong identified Jew means that you are highly connected to a group that you have a strong sense of group membership

that you think of out groups as potentially threatening as enemies and so on other words the psychological

processes of group membership tend to make us view negatively the people in

other groups and that applies to Jews as well as anybody else so strong

identified Jews tend to have strongly positive views of their inroup strongly negative views of the outsiders and you

know that's part of the cultural critique these Jewish intellectuals have very negative views about the culture

and peoples of the outside them in the book Adorno defined parenthood pride in

one's family Christianity adherence to traditional gender roles and attitudes

towards sex and a love of one's own country as pathological

phenomena cultural Marxist wanted to create conflict between the oppressed minority and the oppressing majority

between those with alleged privilege and those without it the working class had been replaced by

minorities all allegiance to family nation and culture was seen as major obstacles and sources of anti-semitism

in order for them to get rid of all resistance to the Jewish interest it would have to be crushed and eroded

within every white person nationalism racial realism

heterosexuality sovereignty homogenity traditionalism loyalty and the nuclear family were looked upon as major

obstacles to the communist takeover of Western civilization thus the cultural

Marxist came up with ways of gradually breaking up our culture from within the

Marxist idea of equality is not actually possible to achieve in reality it is

only about bringing down the ones who stand out the successful the hardworking achievers to the same level as those who

do nothing fail and are lazy this is how you make everyone quote unquote

equal to undermine Western civilization the Jewish extremists called for the

most negative and destructive criticism possible of every sphere of the Gentiles life their anti-white policies they

anticipated would later spread like a virus cultural Marxism has given us anti-white

policies such as racism offenses and hate speech laws gender confusion hookup

culture moral and gender racial relativization homosexualization of

children mass immigration racial tensions forced multiculturalism the

systematic promotion of sexual deviiances in society an unreliable legal system with bias against the

victim of the crimes the breakdown of the nuclear nuclear family and low birth

rates notable philosophers from the Frankfurt school were Herbert Makuz

Theodore Adorno Max Horheimer Walter Benjamin Eric from Fredish Pollock Leo

Leventhal Jurgen Habamas Alfred Schmidt Axel Hornet Sigfred Kakau George Lucash

all of these intellectuals at the Frankfurt School were Jewish

the intellectuals were first to be targeted in all communist states freeth thinking is dangerous to the system

social justice and feminism to name but a few are all anti-white anti-free

speech movements inspired by and born out of critical theory and thus come under the umbrella of cultural Marxism

a popular manifestation of cultural Marxism is also political correctness

which the great English writer Theodore Dal Rimple eloquently defines like this

in my study of communist societies I came to the conclusion that the purpose of communist propaganda was not to

persuade or convince not to inform but to humiliate and therefore the less it

corresponded to reality the better when people are forced to remain silent when they're being told the most obvious lies

or even worse when they're forced to repeat the lies themselves they lose once and for all their sense of property

through sent to obvious lies is in some way to become evil oneself one standing

to resist anything is thus eroded and even destroyed a society of emasculated

liars is easy to control i think if you examine political correctness it has the

same effect and is intended to feminism was part of the Jewish group

evolutionary strategy which came out of the think tank known as the Frankfurt school its goal was to cause resentment

division and weaken the relationships between men and women in the gentile society to destroy the institute of

marriage and the sensitity of the family women would be turned into working units feminism is the idea that women are free

when they serve their employers but slaves when they help their husbands through promoting abortion and radical

feminism the sexists would turn against each other and consequently lower their

demography by preventing childbirth feminist propaganda would brainwash

white women that marriage constitutes slavery for them and that freedom for women cannot be won without the

abolition of marriage and traditional relationships jewish uh uh intellectuals

Jewish activists have been very involved in in in feminism for example there has

been a tendency to see the white male as someone as something that has to be sort

of demoted in society because there's no question that say in the year 1950 that white males ran the show in America

feminism you know women were happy to stay at home and have children now women are encouraged to go off and have

careers and they have very few children you know my view is that it would be far

better i think a lot more women would be happier uh being being wives and mothers

than they would be uh getting into the world of work where they had to be competitive they have to sort of pretty

much put the family on the back burner sexism was the epithet coined by the

abortionpromoting feminist Jew Margaret Feldman this epithet would be used to

attack any person who uphold the natural order and mutually complimentary roles of the sexes in society feminism has

absolutely nothing to do with protecting women it is a cultural Marxist program to degrade and subjugate white men and

of course also white women well one of the things they told me was that um he brought he's at the house one

night and uh we were told he would talk and he started laughing he said "Aaron what do you think women's liberation was

about?" And uh I said I I pretty conventional thinking about it at that

point they said things about women having the right to work getting equal pay with men just like they won the

right to vote you know and he started to laugh he said "You're an idiot." And I said "Why am I an idiot?" He said "You

want Let me tell you what that was about we the Rockefellers funded that we funded Women's Lib you know and we're

the ones who got all over the newspapers and television the Rockefeller Foundation." He says "And you want to

know why?" He says "There were two primary reasons." And they were one reason was we couldn't tax half the

population before women's live and the second reason was now we get the kids in

school at an early age we can indoctrinate the kids how to think which it breaks up their family the the kids

start looking at the state as the family as a school as the officials as their family not as the parents teaching them

and so those are the two pime primary reasons for women's live which I thought up to that point was a noble thing you

know when I saw their intentions behind it where they were coming from when they created it the thought of it I saw I saw

the evil behind what I thought was a noble adventure the Jewish radical feminist Robin Morgan

stated that I feel that man-hating is an honorable and viable political act that

the oppressed have a right to class hatred against a class that is oppressing them we can't destroy the

inequities between men and women until we destroy marriage linda Gordon Jewish

feminist and historian explains that the nuclear family must be destroyed whatever its ultimate meaning the break

up of families now is an objectively revolutionary process in order to do

this Jewish feminist Adria Dorking stated that they will have to destroy the structure of culture as we know it

its art its churches its laws its nuclear families based on fatherite and nation states she continues I want to

see a man beaten to a bloody pulp with a high heel shoved in his mouth like an

apple in the mouth of a pig the Jewish feminist Susan Sonto says that the white race is the cancer of human

history fighting for gay marriage generally involves lying about what

we're going to do with marriage when we get there you know because we lie that the institution of marriage is not going

to change and that is a lie the institution of marriage is going to change and it

should change um and again I I don't think it should exist

the hyperinflation of Germany attracted the international community to Berlin and it was known as the moral cesspit of

Europe where any and every deprived sexual activity could be had the cultural Marxist Jews had introduced

decadence and immorality into German culture movies art and theater that's

why people saw Berlin as the Babylon of the 20s

things that had been considered to be immoral amoral whatever were were became irrelevant and anything went

prostitution was legalized in 1927 mother and daughter teams offered

their services to the same client simultaneously there were no fewer than 17 different prostitute types in this

broadle city

there were clubs where lesbians liked to whip school boys and you'd find military

offices sitting there with children sitting on their laps so a lot of it was play acting but

there were quite a lot of people who also indulged in it the first homosexual and transsexual

propaganda theater plays were made in Berlin in the 1920s the first adultery

theater plays were made by Jewish authors places that you hadn't noticed would

turn into outrageous strip clubs the basement of the restaurants would be

homosexual or lesbian romper rooms and sex clubs

when you have unemployed you also have an increase in sex

workers but it wasn't just Berliners it was tens and maybe hundreds of thousands

of young boys and young girls were coming to Berlin to participate in this

hard currency um sex traffic it was a city that was filled with lesbian life

there was the idea that everywhere you went you didn't have to hide what you were pedophilia was normalized underage

girls managed to make a lucrative living in Berlin as prostitutes little girls were freely available and could be

ordered by telephone and delivered like takeaway meals to

clients every intellectual was leftish the whole political right wing which

basically came from Munich did not play any role in the beginning the whole town

was in the hands of leftist ideas dr manfred Rifer a well-known

leader of the Jews of Bukovina said "Whilst large sections of the German nation were struggling for the

preservation of their race we Jews filled the streets of Germany with our viferations

we supply the press with articles on the subjects of its Christmas and Easter and administer to its religious beliefs in

the manner we consider suitable we ridicule the highest ideals of the German nation and profane the matters

which it holds sacred jewishowned publishing houses like Benjamin Har Leon

Hish and Jacob Stalin company where distributing books that openly undermine

western traditional values jews also pushed an intensive campaign for free abortion as Dr max Hoden Dr

luthther Wolf Martha Ruben Wolf Alfons Goldmid wrote numerous articles

encouraging abortion and birth control for the Germans to lower their birth rates even

further leading the film and theater businesses were Jews such as Joseph Win Sternberg Berto Bre Eric Pomer and a

host of other Jews research into sexuality was led by Jewish sexologists

Ivan BL and Magnus Hfield the transgender community encouraged primitive sex operations because men and

women no longer felt comfortable in their natural roles with prostitution drugs pedophilia homosexuality adultery

sadism masochism decadent art and even beastiality rampant Germany was an

unsafe place for the traditional German family the conservative Germans looked at Berlin with disdain destroying what

was left of the national spirit criminal gangs lived from prostitution drug trafficking illegal

gambling pornography robbery and burglary the police were underpaid

corrupt and felt totally powerless because of the constitutional limitations of police authority

maurice Samuel was a Romanianborn Jewish and scientist novelist translator and

lecturer in 1924 he stated explicitly in his own book You Gentiles that we Jews

we are the destroyers and will remain the destroyers forever nothing that you will do will meet our needs and demands

we will forever destroy because we want a world of our own the Jew Dr kurt Muner

wrote in his novel Devon the way to scan we have corrupted

the blood of all the races of Europe perhaps we have infected them today

everything is unified our thinking is in everything living our spirit rules the

world we are the masters for everything that has power today is the child of our

spirit one may hate us one may drive us away our enemies may triumph over our

physical weakness but we are no longer to be gotten rid of we have devoured the peoples conquered their races defiled

them broken their strength made everything rotten lazy and corrupt with our stale culture our spirit can no

longer be exterminated rabbi Harry Watton said "The communist soul is the soul of

Judaism when we look deeper into the nature of communism we see that it's essentially nothing else than Judaism."

Since the Jews are the highest and most cultural people on earth the Jews have a right to subordinate to themselves the

rest of mankind and to be the masters over the whole world the Jews will become the masters over the whole earth

and they will subordinate to themsel all nations judaism is communism

internationalism the universal brotherhood of man the emancipation of the working class and the human society

it is with these spiritual weapons that the Jews will conquer the world and the

human race the Aryans will be destroyed and Marxism will

triumph the honest Wymer Jewish poet Stefanig now feared a backlash against

Jewy saying "It's disgusting how Jews are taking everything by storm should it

not be our responsibility to anticipate the justified anti-semitic indignation

and call our people back to their senses
