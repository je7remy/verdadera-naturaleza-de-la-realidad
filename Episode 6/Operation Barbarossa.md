[Music] stalin violated the Soviet Polish non-aggression pact by invading Poland

in 1939 stalin violated the Soviet Finnish

non-aggression pact by invading Finland in 1939 without any declaration of war

starting the winter war the heroic Fins fought back the big

red army stalin bombed Sweden in 1940 stalin

violated a provision of the Soviet German non-aggression pact ribbon molotov by invading Lithuania Estonia

and Latapia in 1940 Bolsheviks rolled in to terrorize torture and kill the people

in the standard communist practice the Soviet cattle car deportations afflicted

more than a half million Estonian Latian and Lithuanian Christian Europeans who were shipped to the Gulag 12% of the

entire Baltic population was either deported to Siberia or executed by the Jewish Soviet secret

police stalin grabbed a piece of eastern Romania in 1940 and forced Romanian to

surrender Bezarabia Mulavia in a sickening double standard the allies remained silent about this brutal

Soviet aggression instead the Churchill Stalin pact was signed on 15th of

October 1939 secretary of State for War Church Churchill signed the executive

documents of this pact on 8th of February 1940 in London the Allies did

not give a rat's ass about Poland they only used her to start the war against Germany and now still no boycotts and no

war declarations on Soviet no anti-communist propaganda in the media

and no Stalin is the wararmonger nothing since 1933 when he befriended the

Soviets Roseell had consistently maintained close relations with people who were either communists or communist

sympathizers hitler was well aware that Stalin was on his way to invade Europe his suspicions about Stalin have since

the fall of Soviet been proven as being legitimate document number

103202/6 signed Chief of Staff Kurel Moritzkco in 1940 revealed that Stalin

was preparing to invade Western Europe in July 1941 in a massive invasion

called Oparatia Grosa Operation Thunderstorm it is dated 18th of September 1940 3

months before the German operation Barbar Roa was signed after George Sukov

became chief of the general staff in February 1941 the plan was called MP41

Mubilis Plan 41 it can be found in the so-called Osopaya Papka a file which

contains about 100,000 top secret documents in the book Laool or

Icebreaker Russian Jewish historian Victor Subuv gives us compelling proof

that Hitler was forced into a preemptive strike against a massive Soviet military machine ready to invade and destroy the

whole of Western Europe sever of quotes top secret Soviet documents which proves

that the Soviet army was entirely built as an offensive force stalin was using the classical divide and conquer

strategy he was first hoping for Britain France and Germany to be exposed destroyed and exhausted so that the Red

Army would be able to invade their territory in the west all Bolshevik preparations were for invasion not

defense the Soviet Union had already moved division after division closer to the German border it was producing five

to 10 times the number of tanks machine guns cannons and airplanes that Germany was able to produce for every month that

passed by Germany's odds got worse given the communists openly stated ambition of

conquering the world there could not have been any doubt that Stalin was ready for an assault on Germany in 1941

Admiral MG Kusnes was a Soviet Navy minister as well as a member of the

central committee of the Soviet Communist Party in his post-war memoirs he recalled "For me there is one thing

beyond all argument." Stalin not only did not exclude the possibility of war with Hitler's Germany on the contrary he

considered such a war inevitable stalin made preparations for war wide and

varied preparations beginning on dates which he himself had selected hitler upset his calculations germanalians had

learned of the planned Soviet attack on Europe and prepared the counter plan operation

Barbarosa on 22nd of June 1941 Hitler invaded Soviet in a preemptive attack

this German preemptive strike saved Europe from the Red Army at least for a while

stalin was about to strike Western Europe with 3 million soldiers when getting caught with their pants down as

German soldiers carried belt buckles engraved with the words God meets God with us entered their now anti-Christian

red land from the Baltic to the Black Sea German soldiers were getting into

positions to launch the invasion the most brutal battles in recorded history took place along the Eastern

front which stretched back to Germany through the Soviet Union Hungary Romania

Bulgaria the Balkans Ukraine Bellarus Poland and the Baltic states in these

landscapes Europe's bravest soldiers sacrificed their lives to liberate Europe from the Tower of the Bolsheviks

ukrainians Russians Estonians Lapians and other Eastern Europeans welcomed the

Germans as they were liberated from the slavery and torture previously endured under Soviet hands local women blessed

the Germans as they

[Music] passed women gave the soldiers food and the soldiers even helped them restoring

homes and churches the German villages what was left of us was herded into the

cattle trains and shipped to Siberia and quite a few villages really disappeared

that way and it was literally a matter of hours if not minutes until our turn in Halat came and I understand that

actually half of Halat was exiled and we were already sitting at the railroad

station and this was September 1941 when the German army overran the

Ukraine and stopped the exiling stopped the trains they stopped the trains and

it was to us as if the Lord had sent us the angels here were people who spoke

German who spoke high German who stopped the terror that had been upon us for 25

years who came and opened the churches for us and said "You can have all the services you want." It was like heaven

my mother to the day she died never never stopped talking about the

wonderful two years that she had with the German army when the German army came and took over the villages they

moved in on us they took over the houses we gave them gladly they could have my

grandmother started cooking as if cooking went out of fashion and uh it it was magnificent when the Germans came

and they set up apparently certain headquarters that they had some radio broadcast certain stations and so on but

most of them moved of course ran over us and moved east in their fight toward Moscow and their in their push toward

Moscow but some stayed back and we were absolutely convinced that the Germans

had come to save us from communism and never was there any reason for us to change our minds why should we the

Germans were heroes in our eyes

[Music]

as the Germans advanced east millions of Russians refused to fight for Stalin and instead surrendered to the Germans

stalin's tyranny was hated by every freedomloving Russian so hated in fact that whole formations surrendered and

volunteered to fight for the Germans instead taking back their motherland from the terror of Jewish bulsheism

hitler viewed communism as a poison to Europe and decided that his life's purpose was to root out and destroy it

the Germans had nothing against the Russians as people but instead against communism many Russians volunteered to

fight for Hitler instead nearly half a million Russian volunteers served on the front lines and another 100,000 or more

serving in in other non-combat positions the anti-communist soldiers of the

Russian Liberation Army wore German uniforms with a Russian patch in 1944 it

was officially renamed the Armed Forces of the Committee for the Liberation of the Peoples of Russia they were led by

General Andre Vassov but under German high command they fought bravely primarily in key roles against the

Communist Parts general Vlov and Hydra Shimler met and

ironed out details of the formation of a massive new army composed of Russians

they went over what was called the Smolinsk Manifesto written in 1942 which

outlined goals of liberating Russia from the communist occupation it stipulated

that in the new Russia every people will obtain national freedom including the right of self-determination the

realization of this right to national independence and freedom is possible however only after destroying Stalin and

his click Himmler and Vasso agreed that there would initially be five divisions

organized from Russian PWs and workers from the occupied Eastern territories whose number by then had reached over 5

million hitler also formed the Insat group units for the necessary removal of

the bloodthirsty Jewish Bolshevik leadership from the Soviet cities criminal communist partisans were

executed and hanged as punishment for what they had done to the Christian Russians stalin was now rumored to have

suffered a breakdown adah Fitler explained "You probably all felt that this was a bitter

and difficult step for me." The German people have never had hostile feelings towards the peoples of Russia during the

last two decades however the Jewish Bolevist rulers in Moscow have attempted to set not only Germany but all of

Europe as flame germany has never attempted to spread its national socialist world view to Russia rather

the Jewish Bolevitz rulers in Moscow have constantly attempted to subject us

and the other European peoples to their rule they have attempted this not only intellectually but above all through

military means the results of their efforts in every nation were only chaos misery and

starvation before the battle of Moscow Hitler had succeeded in defeating the Soviet army and taking numerous

prisoners then an unbelievable freeze happened 40 to 50° C below zero the cold

caused problems for the Germans the German troops had only summer uniforms and equipment was also freezing on the

spot no tanks could move the weather would intensify and temperatures plummet

time would decisively turn against the Germans and before the last push of Worm

into Moscow Germany was stuck

meanwhile Roosevelt extended a lend lease act which would send even more financial and military aid to the Soviet

Union 11.3 billion or around $150 billion today to save the communist

regime it was at that time the masses of Siberian troops were brought back from

the Russian Far East and thrown against the Germans the Germans did not manage

to take Moscow and were instead pushed back again stalin felt the need to have

his troops backed by blocking units tasked to execute anyone retreating from

the front he also branded anyone captured as a traitor and later executed

these former prisoners while sending their family members to the camps you have to remember that uh when the Red

Army marched behind the Red Army was a second army the NKVD army which had its

own tanks its own machine guns and so on firing forward so that nobody could move back

stalin's son Jacob Shugashilli was captured by the Vermacht in 1942 the Vermach offered to exchange

German prisoners with Stalin for the return of his son stalin rejected this and stated "I have no son named Yukov."

Although the circumstances are unclear Yukov later died in captivity some say that he ran into a fence surrounding a P

camp some say that he was shot when trying to escape

closing into Stalenrad Stalin now cowardly fled the

city the battle of Stalingrad between the Germans and the Soviets was fought for control of the strategically vital

Soviet city that Stalin had named after himself today known as Vulgugrad the

battle was one of the bloodiest in history with military and civilian deaths of nearly 2 million stalin's

refusal to pull the Red Army out of the city led to a long barrier and tremendous amount of suffering for the

hungry citizens in July 1942 Stalin issued an order preventing any civilians

even women and children from leaving the city after the German defense captured most of the city the US lend equipped

Red Army destroyed the Germans with bloody house-to-house fighting the

losses suffered by the Germans would make victory in Russia impossible germany's war economy was not

set to total war mode until 1943 i.e too

late on February the 2nd 1943 Field Marshal Friedish Palace finally

surrendered to the Soviets 300,000 German Croatian Hungarian Romanian and

Italian soldiers including 35,000 Russian volunteers fighting for Germany

against the communist had now been surrounded over 11,000 refused to lay

down their weapons that the official surrendered preferring instead to fight until death against the Bolsheviks by

early March all resistance had been wiped out those who remained were forced

to march east or work themselves to death in Soviet death camps historians have now confirmed that

of the 11,237 letters that were sent by soldiers to their families almost all of

them expressed a willingness and determination to fight communism and die fighting for national socialism and the

furer Adeo Hitler the battle of Stalingright would be a turning point in

the war after the battle of Kursk in 5th of July to 23rd of August 1943 the Germans

were outnumbered by more than 2 to1 and suffered casualties of around 203,000

while the communists lost 83,000 the Germans did not achieve their goal germany was forced into a fullscale

retreat as the US opened a new front in Italy germany would never again regain

the initiative in the war the Germans were steadily forced

completely out of Soviet territory after which the Soviet pursued them across Eastern Europe and into Germany itself

in 1945 the Germans would now fight in freezing weather conditions and at the same time offer much needed protection

to refugees fleeing the murderous communists more and more people desperately fled west to reach safety

from the communists and then of course in 1943 the story changed and the

Germans were pushed back and in the push back they moved us with them what was

left of us and we went willingly there was no no moving at gunpoint had we

stayed back the communists would have taken us and executed us or shipped us to Siberia so we very very willingly

moved retreated with the Germans you know here we were walking toward the Reich toward Germany which had always

been in our minds a fictitious place we absolutely believed in Adolf Hitler we

believed in the in the nature of his struggle in the merits of his struggle

we had these magnificent German soldiers protecting us all the way and we were walking into the Reich so there was

there were lots of songs along the way in the beginning in the fall there were all these Hitler youth with their

beautiful snappy clothing and on bicycles and they were giving us fresh water and the BM girls were cooking and

you know serving us coffee and so on we always were fed by the army they had kitchen field kitchens traveling grim

then the winter came and food was getting short the horses were getting

sick uh the road was getting narrower it was extremely cold when I think of the

war and of the track I do not think of hunger so much as of cold it was always

always cold that's what I remember and then of course once the winter came it

became harder and harder we had to often stay overnight in

strange houses the army would confiscate houses would put the refugees there the

army protected us to the end the army never ever let us down never let us down

to the very end keep in mind also that Germany at that time did not need

refugees you know they were starving they were struggling they had nothing

they took us in as as as family

while the soldiers on the ground were battling to end the war leading politicians were doing all they could

for political reasons to continue the conflict in October 1940 when Germany

was in total control of the European War there was no chance of British victory

unless the US could be dragged into the conflict a prominent member of the British war cabinet Lord Arthur

Greenwood offered the Jews a new world order in hopes of enlisting their

support to bring a reluctant America into the war conflict in the same way it had done in 1917 with the Balfford

Declaration that promised Palestine to the Jews in exchange for bringing about US entry greenwood made a prophetic

statement when we have achieved victory and we surely shall Greenwood promises

in the rebuilding of civilized society after the war there should and will be a real opportunity for Jews everywhere to

make a distinctive and constructive contribution and that 10 million American boys will be needed to do the

job the US would enter the war 14 months later heim Wiseman said to Churchill in

September 1941 "We manage to drag the United States into the First World War

and if they the US do what we demand in regards to Palestine and the Jewish

armed forces then we can get the Jews in the USA to drag the United States into this one

too." Already in 1939 Bridgetier General George Van Horn Mosley exposed the plan

in the New York Tribune the war now proposed is for the purpose of establishing Jewish hedgemony throughout

the world even though the British Empire already had vast resources and millions

of men at her disposal Churchill and Roosevelt would now push for the US to enter the war never before in history

were the American people as anti-war or as united in their views as they were in

1939 about staying out of what they saw as yet another European civil war the

Gallup poll showed 94% of the American people was absolutely against participation in the

war when it began in September 1939 the ordinary people were tired of

these wars despite this fact Roselt forced laws

through Congress contradicting US supposed neutrality in 1939 Roosevelt

repealed the US Neutrality Act in favor of a one-sided supply of arms to Germany's enemies the year after Rosealt

passed the Lendley Act which officially ended his pretense of being neutral in

the war he also allowed American citizens to join the British Air Force in a violation of international law

Roosevelt proceeded to freezing all German assets in the US and announced an oil embargo against aggressor nations $1

billion in lendley's aid was sent to Britain benjamin Gitlo founding member of the US Communist Party wrote in "I

confess in 1940 when I was in Moscow the attitude towards the United States in

the event of war was discussed privately i was the opinion of all the Russian leaders to whom I spoke that the rivalry

between the United States and Japan must actually break out into war between these

two because Roosevelt was well aware of the amount of popular feeling on this issue he would repeatedly lie to the

American people about his love of peace and his determination to keep the US out

of war while simultaneously actually doing everything in his power to take both Europe and America into war as with

the case of Germany Japan had also broken the shackles of Gratell's interest and experienced an economic

miracle in a national rebirth it could not be allowed japan had to be taken out

to become a milking cow of the bankers again on 23rd of June 1941 United States

Interior Secretary Harold Blair wrote in a memo to Roosevelt "There will never be

so good a time to stop the shipment of oil to Japan as we now have there might

develop from the embargoing of oil to Japan such a situation as would make it

not only possible but easy to get into this war in an effective way and if we

should thus indirectly be brought in we would avoid the criticism that we had gone in as an ally of communist Russia

rosewood was of course still looking desperately for a way to enter the war he then froze all Japanese assets in the

US and later forced an oil embargo on Japan in an international act of hostility as a direct result Japan now

lost access to 75% of her overseas trade and 88% of her imported oil this led to

Japan now having insufficient resources to continuing her war with communist China to avoid war the Japanese first

entered into negotiations with US officials who demanded that Japan first would withdraw from communist China

before any embargos would end russot of course knew that the Japanese never

would let themselves be humiliated in such a way if the Japanese refused it

the embargo would continue and they would collapse from economic strangulation if they complied and

withdrew all troops from the mainland communism would sweep Eastern Asia exactly as happened after the war

resulting in communist China and the Korean and Vietnam wars the Japanese

were given a two-headed coin die by starvation or die by communism they

decided to reject both of these options and fight instead war Secretary Henry Stimson

phrased it in his diary we faced a delicate question of the diplomatic fencing to be done so as to be sure that

Japan is put into the wrong and makes the first bad move or vert move the question was how we should maneuver the

Japanese into the position of firing the first shot the major organization which

propagated up public support for US involvement in the European war before the Pearl Harbor attack was the cleverly

named Committee to Defend America by aiding the Allies at the end of 1940

West Virginia Senator Rush D halt issued a detailed examination of the committee

the committee has powerful connections with banks insurance companies financial investing firms in industrial concerns

these in turn exert influence on college presidents and professors as well as on

newspapers radio and other means of communication if the committee succeeded

in getting the US into war Holt warned American boys will spill their blood for

propheteers politicians and patriots if war comes on the hands of the sponsors

of the white committee will be blood the blood of Americans killed in a needless

war in March 1941 a list of most of the committee's financial backers was made

public it revealed the forces eager to bring America into the European war powerful international primarily Jewish

banking interest were well represented in his diary entry of the

1st of May 1941 Charles A lindberg the American heroic aviator and peace leader

exposed the coalition that was pushing the United States into the war the pressure for war is high and mounting

the people are opposed to it but the administration seems to have the bit in its teeth and is hellbent on its way to

war most of the Jewish interests in the country are behind war and they control a huge part of our press and radio and

most of our motion pictures dr milton Eisenhower was General Eisenhower's

brother he said "President Roosevelt found it necessary to get the country into World War II to save his social

policies." Early in 1941 Congressman Martin Diaz

committee came into possession of a strategic map which gave clear proof of the intentions of the Japanese to make

an assault on Pearl Harbor the strategic map was prepared by the Japanese Imperial Military Intelligence

Department martin wrote "As soon as I received the document I telephoned Secretary of State Coral Hull and told

him what I had secretary Holt directed me not to let anyone know about the map

and stated that he would call me as soon as he talked to President Roosevelt in about an hour he telephoned to say that

he had talked to Roosevelt and they agreed that it would be very serious if any information concerning this map

reached the news services i told him it was a great responsibility to withhold

such vital information from the public the secretary assured me that he and Roosevelt considered it essential to

national defense general Elliot R thorps served as a military attach in Dutch

controlled Java Netherlands Indies in 1941 when the Dutch broke a Japanese

diplomatic code the intercepted message referred to planned Japanese attacks on

Hawaii the Philippines and Thailand he immediately cabled the information to

Washington and promptly delivered copies of the decoded text to including President Roosevelt Secretary of State

Cordel Hull Secretary of War Henry Stimson Army Chief of Staff General George Marshall and the Chief of Naval

Operations Admiral Harold Stark copies also went to Harry Hopkins FDR's

Communist Adviser because the US and Britain now had cracked Japan's naval communication codes all important

Japanese codes were broken russult knew about the coming surprise attack but no

warning was sent to the commanders at Pearl Harbor naval intelligence

intercepted and translated numerous Japanese naval dispatches some clearly revealing that Pearl Harbor had been

targeted if a break in the US relations was forthcoming Tokyo would issue a special radio warning the message to be

repeated three times during a weather report was Higashi no kaz a east wind

rain east wind signified the United States rain signified diplomatic split a

war this prospective message was deemed so significant that US radio monitors

was constantly watching for it and the Navy Department typed it up on special reminder cards on December 4th Higashi

no Kaz A was broadcast and picked up by Washington intelligence while issuing the final

provocations of Japan FDR and his military chairman George Marshall set

the bait for the Japanese fish to bite

the Japanese in the hopes of gaining an early advantage decided to impose as much danger to the US Navy as possible

on the morning of 7th of December 1941 Japanese planes launched from aircraft

carriers attacked the American fleet at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii sinking or

heavily damaging 18 ships including eight battleships destroying 188 planes

the attack on Pearl Harbor ignited a sudden press frenzy and a wave of patriotic enthusiasm for entering the

war roosevelt and the people around him would finally have their world war the

attack was not a surprise roosevelt deliberately allowed 2,400 US sailors to die without any

warning from the diary of Henry Stimson we can see that Stimson's immediate feeling was not one of sorrow or

outraged over the lost lives at Pearl Harbor but rather of relief when the

news first came that Japan had attacked us my first feeling was of relief that a

crisis had come oliver Littleton wartime British production manager was

undeniably correct when he declared "It is a travesty on history ever to say that the United States was forced into

the war america provoked the Japanese to such an extent they were forced to attack." The text of Hirohito's war

declaration appeared once in the New York Times before its allegation disappeared in the winner's official

history we hereby declare war upon the United States of America and the British

Empire to ensure the stability of East Asia and to contribute to world peace to

cultivate friendship among nations and to enjoy prosperity in common with all nations has always been the guiding

principle of our empire's foreign policy it has truly been unavoilable and far from our wishes that our empire has been

brought to crosswarts with America and Britain hamington Fish made the first speech in

Congress on 8th of September 1941 asking for declaration of war against Japan in

his book FDR the other side of the coin Fish says he is ashamed of that speech

today and if he had known what Roosevelt had been doing to provoke Japan to attack he would never have asked for a

declaration of war fish said Rose was the main firebrand to light the fuse of war both in Europe and the Pacific

in 1943 when Japan occupied the important rice exporter Burma the

British bought up massive amounts of rice and hoarded it churchill then ordered the diversion of food away from

India in order to feed his own troops instead now a rare commodity the price

of rice went up four-fold the wheat from Australia which could have been delivered to starving Indians before was

instead transported to British troops even worse British colonial authorities

again under Churchill's leadership actually refused offers from Canada and the United States to ship free food to

the starving country churchill intentionally starved more than 4

million innocent Bengales to death to pump resources into the war against the

Axis powers churchill hated Indians almost as much as he hated Germans

because India wanted its independence from Britain gandhi was also very

positive to Hitler later at a war cabinet meeting Churchill

blamed the Indians themselves for the famine saying that they breed like

rabbits these victims were not Jewish and that's why you never hear about them

churchill did not even try to hide the fact that he hated Indians and Germans i

hate Indians they are beastly people he also said that Gandhi ought to be laying

bound hand and foot at the gates of Delhi and then trampled on by an enormous elephant with the new viseroy

seated on its back churchill's colorful commentary may have been a product of

his terminal alcohol addiction or just his overall antisocial impulsivity

what makes it all a bigger tragedy is that the victims have never been compensated and the person responsible

for the famine has never even been held responsible instead he has been

celebrated as a hero [Music]

the soft underbelly of Europe was left vulnerable to an attack and the oil fields of Romania fueled the German

military hitler worried that the Allies would invade Yugoslavia Greece and the Balkan nations to cut up Germany's oil

supply and launch a final push upon Germany from the south and southeast

such an attack would be disastrous and detrimental to Germany but instead of just taking this opportunity to put an

end to the war Churchill Dwight Eisenhower Montgomery and George Marshall instead insisted upon making

preparations for an invasion of heavily fortified northern France instead to prolong the war kill more Europeans and

buy the Soviets much needed time to march westward and eventually enable Stalin to take the whole of Eastern

Europe as they had agreed

the reason for this was that Russell and Henry Morganthal envisioned a post-war world in which the Soviets and the

United States would join forces to lay the foundations for a communist international world government a UN at

the sixth hour of the sixth day of the sixth month of 1944 British American and

Canadian forces crossed the English Channel and launched a D-Day invasion landing in German occupied France via

the coast of Normandy roosevelt and Churchill had for years provided the Soviet Union with military and financial

aid now they would finally send in their troops to fight and die for

nearly 10,000 men were killed storming Hitler's fortified beaches of

Normandy in the end overlords successfully established an initial beach head of 100,000 troops from this

base in northern France the allies were reinforced for the push towards Germany at the same time the Red Terror

advanced from the east equipped to the teeth with advanced American aid from

Roosevelt with Italy also under Allied occupation Germany now had three fronts

to defend west south and east

in order to intentionally give the communists even more time to conquer and rape Eastern Europe General Eisenhower

and Marshall delay the advance of General Patton's third army going so far as to cut off shipments of gasoline to

Patton's army patton said in August 1944 "At the present time our chief

difficulty is not the Germans but gasoline if they would give me enough gas I could go all the way to Berlin

between December 1944 and January 1945 the German forces made a last desperate

effort to drive back the Allied forces which took the Allies completely by surprise and almost turned the war on

its head fought in the force around the mountain region of Belgium the mighty German offensive would be known as the

Battle of the Bulge american forces were met with German panzer divisions in the

Ardan force battling the frigid weather as they fought each other it was a decisive moment in World War II which

would give Hitler a last chance to drive back the approaching Allied armies to the coastline his wish was to force them

back again to a negotiated peace a quarter of a million German soldiers

rolled towards the western front and move their units in secret towards points east of Arden in late October

the allies underestimated the Germans and thought they did not have the military strength for such an attack in

December with the Germans advance and surround Baston then drive the Moose

River american troops discovered German troops in front and behind them thousands of Allied soldiers destroyed

their weapons and gave up in one of the largest surreners in military history the ammunition was short as battalions

were down to 10 rounds per gun and the weather conditions were still cold and snowy the freezing cold conditions did

not make it easy for any side in the battles frostbite was rampant and the bitter cold additional

causalities the Germans floating to encircle the allies in Baston from all sides if they wanted the Germans could

now easily taken Baston but instead they gave the Americans an ultimatum of an honorable surrender the Allies would

have none of it allied planes instead arrived and started strafing and bombing the Germans and dropping supplies to the

Allies enough to make the Americans turn the tide on January 3rd the Allies launched a counterattack and on January

16th patrols from the first and third armies met north of Baston and pushed back the dramas again by early February

the Germans had been pushed back where they started again at the same time the Soviets had taken the vital oil fields

in the east which caused lack of fuel for the German tanks in the west this lack of fuel prevented them from

reaching the Muse River and left the Lufafa permanently stranded german losses exhausted the last reserves and

mounted at 84,834 the remaining German forces would now be driven back to the retreat in

Berlin the Battle of the Bulge was also the bloodiest battle US forces fought in the war which resulted in 19,000 dead

47,000 wounded and 23,000

captured when St churchill appointed the Jewish professor Lindamman as his personal adviser Lindamman together with

Churchill decided that Germany would be subjected to area carpet saturation

unrestricted bombing or what the victims themselves called terror bombing lindamman suggested the bombing of

German cities and that workingclass civilian areas were legitimate targets these bombings began on 10th of August

1940 with the bombing of the small town of Fryberg this was before the Germans began bombing British cities the goal of

the bombings was to break the spirit of the Germans between 1940 and 1945 61

German cities with a total population of 25 million souls were destroyed in the

bombing campaigns by the Allies the Allies specifically targeted innocent civilians many large cities such as

Cologne and Essen experienced more than 250 raids each churchill's deliberate

strategy was killing as many German civilians as possible "perhaps the next

time round the way to do it will be to kill women children and the civilian population," Churchill explained in 1943

when the US finally had rearmed the British the civilization that the Germans had fought fiercely for was now

surrounded from every single angle each plane heading for Germany was loaded with tons of high explosives and

incendiary bombs over the cities the Americans strategically bombed industrial plans during the day while

the British purposely targeted innocent civilians at night aiming at houses of the workingclass communities the plan

was to inflict as much damage to destroy as many homes and to kill as many women children and elderly as possible

churchill wanted more than two cities a month demolished until none would be left bomber Harris championed the

bombing of cities the city he was most focused on was Berlin in documents from Operation Thunderclad he stated that he

wanted the total devastation of the central of Berlin more bombs while weight would be

dropped on the city of Berlin than on the whole of Great Britain during the entire war

german cities will be subjected to an ordeal the lack of which has never been experienced by a country in continuity

severity and magnitude to achieve this end there are no length of violence to

which we will not go guaranteed Winston

Churchill as swarms of British bombers began a systematic destruction of Germany tons of high explosives were

unleashed on the nation as schools hospitals homes beautiful ancient art and architecture were all obliterated

the allies thought that this would lower German morale on both the home and battle fronts to the point that absolute

collapse was inevitable for the Third Reich in the horrific war crimes instigated by Churchill and Arthur

Bomber Harris hundreds of thousands of German civilians would now be burned alive in consequential firestorms in

German cities many of these raids consisted of initial attacks using high

explosive bombs to break up buildings followed with attacks using thousands of incendiary bombs to settle all the

fabrics furnishing and upholstery exposed by the explosives in this way

firestorms were created under the right conditions which burned tens of thousands of people alive especially the

women and children at home while the men were at the front the first explosive bombs blasted

the roofs of buildings in preparation for incendiary devices knocking out the air raid warning systems and causing

massive destruction and death fireh halls and water manes were also completely destroyed when the roaring

bombers released their lethal cargo a crescendo of fire descended on the cities dresston was turned into an ocean

of fire air temperatures rose to 600° C

winds up to 45 m/s sucked all oxygen into the center of the storm hundreds of

thousands of people were burned alive a ref crewman said there were people down

there being fried to death in melted asphalt on the roads they were being burnt up and we were shuffling

incendiary bombs into this holocaust i felt terribly sorry for the people in that fire I was helping to stoke

[Music] up it was evil thousands of firebombs

dropping all over the place explosions heat fire people screaming people

burning people alike well it wasn't after about uh half an hour it it

started developing into uh something which was really bad lot came over and

and dropped all these incenders and then of course as wave after wave came

over so uh the impact got heavier 35 minutes 40 minutes after the first bombs

had dropped that the bomb dropped outside the building that we was in killed her killed my mate Harry and

uh and about 3/4 of the people in there were killed and so you go out and you come

out of there and the whole place is a furnace it's a furnace cuz we were in the center of Treasure

it was the uh it was the second wave which really brought the tornado into being cuz then

they started dropping the £4,000 blockbusters £4,000 for nap arm which if

you dropped anything within about 300 y was immediately incinerated to feed the

fire so you get the wind coming in that's really tornado folks and you you

just can't you you it dehumanizes everything that anything that you've experienced before they try to cross

over to us a group of them and the first lot of them got stuck in the middle of it they couldn't get away and in the end

they caught a light they were still alive and then they then and then then

they exploded wave upon wave of phosphorous

and incendiary bombs washed over the defenseless civilian German population thousands of German elderly women and

children suffocated or was burned alive in basement and tunnels where they were hiding as the oxygen was sucked out of

their hiding places and pulled toward the blaze to feed the flames thousands more were hurdled into the air and

sucked by the winds right into the fire some perished in a blast of white heat heat intense enough to melt the human

flesh wherever there was a water fountain or canel the city's inhabitants jumped in only to be boiled alive the

attacks left the cities a raging sea of fire hundreds of smaller fires merged into single huge

conflrations huge masses of air within sucked in to feed the inferno causing an artificial tornado the firestorm in

Dresston was so massive that pilots reported that their cockpits actually were illuminated by the great fire the

air suction of the fire was so powerful that it uprooted trees and lifted roofs from houses miles away total panic

After first having blasted the targeted towns to splinters the British and American bombers soon returned to strafe

terrified groups of refugees and rescuers as they tried to escape the Allies lured the civilians from their

shelters into the open again as they thought it was all over twice as many

bombers returned with massive loads of incendiary bombs and ignited all that remained and spread raging firestorms to

the places where refugee Germans had fled us Mustangs appear low over the

cities strafing anything that moved including coloms of rescue vehicles and

animals the low-flying Mustangs machine gun helpless patients as well as thousands of old men women and children

everyone who had escaped the city when the last plane had left the sky the cities were left in ruins the streets

were filled with rats swarming over piles of corpses people have been liquefied into a yellied mass that

melted into the asphalt of the road and some were left in ashes millions of refugees fled the

cities taking with them stories of the most terrible horror they had ever

witnessed

for my

the RAF's relentless campaign against Germany during the final months of the war was a massive war crime which served

absolute no military purpose the worst of all the raids was the one unleashed on Dresston it had no strategical or

tactical gain in the war whatsoever for the allies dresston had no military bases no communication centers or heavy

industry and no air defense it was known as a showplace for culture and one of the most beautiful cities in Germany

this Allied air raid left 24,866 homes destroyed 11 square miles

of prime real estate and irreplaceable cultural treasures totally devastated 35,000 recognizable corpses available to

be identified and hundreds of thousands of unrecognizable ones more than 35ths

of Dresston was completely destroyed by bombing raids that lasted more than 14 hours because of so many refugees

fleeing eastward resided in Dresston it is difficult to say exactly how many were killed most honest revisionists

estimated death toll to range from total 350,000 to 600,000 dead it was called

terror bombing among the Germans i think even some of the RAF British pilots and the Americans also knew it as terror

bombing they weren't kidding themselves they knew what they were doing they were uh slaughtering women and children down below in the German cities this was

sanctified it was sanctioned by the British and American governments this deliberate attempt to kill as many

people as possible a deliberate attempt to scorch from the face of the earth every German city above a certain size

let's say 25,000 people we've all heard of Dresden if we haven't we should have heard of Dresden but what most people

don't know is that almost every German city suffered a similar fate that is terrible devastating bombing and then a

firestorm that's created by dropping phosphorous bombs to ignite the rubble that's blown this town to

bits nothing prepared me for seeing women and children alike and flying through the air nothing prepared me for

that after Dresdon I was a nutcase took me 40 years to get over it i don't think

I even laughed for 40 years i couldn't couldn't even laugh at anything i said and I still say and I've said it in

print and I've said it and I'll never forget the people who ordered those raids and that goes for all of them

churchill Atley all of them whatever they can say they were still carrying on bombing other cities like this and then

of course they tried to put the blame on somebody else no it it the we were

supposed to be the good guys and we finished up being worse than they were what annoys me is all this was done in

our name the terror bombings of Germany during World War II left about 3 million

Germans dead 500,000 of them children up to 10 million wounded and 25 million

homeless
